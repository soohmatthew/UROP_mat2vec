The development of materials science in the ancient world involved the accumulation of intuitive inventions and the development of crafts. The antiquity established natural philosophy ideas about the nature of matter and divided all existent things into organic and inorganic worlds (Democritus, Epicurus, Aristotle). In the early Middle Ages, alchemy was widespread, with an idea of transmuting elements into gold. Although alchemical ideas were erroneous, they brought some benefits, contributing to the development of scientific experiment. The New Times marked the rapid development of fundamental sciences that promoted theoretical and practical materials science.

This paper examines how third grade students' materials science performance changes over the course of instruction based on an engineering design challenge. We conducted a case study of nine students who participated in engineering design-based science instruction with the goal of constructing a stable, quiet, thermally comfortable model house. The learning outcome of materials science practices was assessed by clinical interviews conducted before and after the instruction, and the learning process was assessed by students' workbooks completed during the instruction. The interviews included two materials selection tasks for designing a sturdy stepstool and an insulated pet habitat. Results indicate that: (1) students significantly improved on both materials selection tasks, (2) their gains were significantly positively associated with the degree of completion of their workbooks, and (3) students who were highly engaged with the workbook's reflective record-keeping tasks showed the greatest improvement on the interviews. These findings suggest the important role workbooks can play in facilitating elementary students' learning of science through authentic activity such as engineering design.\", \"Older, established disciplines, such as physics and chemistry, cover clearly identifiable fields.

And should materials science departments define a stable curriculum, or instead adapt and readapt to an ever-changing market?\", \"Afterschool programs have garnered much attention as promising environments for learning where children can engage in rich science activities. Yet, little is known about the kinds of instructional materials used in typical, large-scale afterschool programs that implement science with diverse populations of children. In this study, we investigated the types, features, and use of science instructional materials at more than 150 public afterschool program sites across California. Using afterschool site survey data, we categorized the types and the range of materials used at the sites. We then collected a subsample of the instructional materials for in-depth analysis of their support features for enabling staff and children to enact science. We also interviewed afterschool site staff to better understand how they selected and used materials. Results from our analysis of survey and interview data show that afterschool staff primarily used stand-alone lessons and activities found on the Internet or in activity books as resources for planning and enacting science. Our analysis of the subsample of instructional materials indicate that curricular materials, while used less frequently by afterschool staff, have on average more of the support features that would help them implement high-quality science experiences with children.\", \"Novel developments of wood-based materials and technologies since the dawn of history have extended the base of wood science.

The authors review the literature on teachers and science curriculum materials. The review is organised around three main questions: What do teachers do when using science curriculum materials?, What happens when teachers use science curriculum materials? and Why do teachers make the decisions they do? For each question, the authors first summarise the findings of two key reviews from the mathematics education literature, then situate the findings from science education in juxtaposition with those findings. The review uncovers that relatively little is understood about the mechanism underlying how teachers interact with curriculum materials. To try to address this gap, complementing and extending the field's existing understandings of the teacher-curriculum relationship, the authors make four propositions, grounded in the literature on self-regulation. The propositions reflect a mechanism for teacher curricular decision-making. The self-regulation perspective also helps to develop more targeted support for science teachers aimed at the uptake, adaptation and enactment of curriculum materials in ways that are intended, and that teachers themselves experience as an improvement in their teaching. The authors conclude with a call for research that further explores the ways in which individual science teachers' decision-making is situated within the wider sociocultural context.\", \"The cross-disciplinary field of materials science emerged and grew to prominence in the second half of the twentieth century, drawing theoretical and experimental strength from the rapid progress in several natural sciences disciplines and connecting to many industrial applications. In this article, we chronicle and analyze how materials science established itself in Swedish universities in the 1960s and after. We build on previous historical accounts of the growth of materials science elsewhere, especially in the United States, and the conceptual guidance that these studies offer. We account for the emergence and growth of materials science in Sweden from the early influences brought back by academics from postdoc stays in the United States, through the creation of the first funding programs in the late 1970s, to the breakthrough of materials science in Sweden in the 1990s and its growth to a true area of strength and priority in Swedish science today. In line with previous studies, we highlight the role of funding agencies, providing the means for new cross -disciplinary activities across and between traditional disciplinary structures, and the role of new instrumentation, providing new experimental opportunities and uniting disciplinarily disparate research activities around common goals, as crucial in the process. Also, the role of entrepreneurially minded individuals is evident in the story: materials science was developed in Sweden largely by a new generation of scientists who established new activities within existing organizational structures, and thus accomplished long-term institutional change in a well -established field and system.\", \"The manipulation of materials, and to some extent also their systematic classification, form an integral part of the skills and culture of all societies. Yet it took long for proper sciences (e. g., metallurgy, glass technology, polymer chemistry or solid-state physics) to develop out of many processing procedures, tapping the accumulated knowledge about specific material characteristics. In the late 20th century an overarching science of workable materials emerged: materials science. This concept and term originated from major boosts in materials research during WWII and the Cold War, first financed by the U.S. Department of Defense and the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA). The COSMAT-Report from 1974, written by the American Presidential Science Advisory Committee's,, Committee on the Survey of Materials Science and Engineering\\\" four years after its inception, and subsequent reports heralded in the second institutionalization phase of materials science in the USA and with some delay also elsewhere.

The developments within the German-speaking realm, thus far unduly neglected in these debates, are added.

Against Bensaude-Vincent's (2001:242) thesis that materials science still is an \\\"aggregation of fragments of knowledge\\\", I argue that by 2010 materials science did indeed achieve disciplinary status in a historically rare and enduring process of discipline formation through \\\"emergence by integration\\\" rather than by differentiation.\", \"The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between motives for science learning and factors related to academic achievement in science by path analysis. Two hundred twenty-two junior high school students were given questionnaires on their perceptions of motives for science learning, and factors related to academic achievement in science, i.e., attitude for science (feelings for science), interest in and concern for biological teaching materials, and competence in science learning. Sub-dimensional components of motives for science learning was constructed. By applying factor analysis, four factors were found. Motives for science learning was evaluated by a mastery orientation scale, an activity orientation scale, a reality orientation scale, and a profit orientation scale. Based on previous work's model, a new causality model composed of four levels in science was constructed : attitude for science --> interest in and concern for biological teaching materials --> motives for science learning --> competence in science. Through this analysis, the causal relationship between motives for science learning and factors related to academic achievement in science was revealed.\", \"The field of combinatorial synthesis and \\\"artificial intelligence\\\" in materials science is still in its infancy. In order to develop and accelerated strategy in the discovery of new materials and processes, requires the need to integrate both the experimental aspects of combinatorial synthesis with the computational aspects of information based design of materials.

The development of materials was driven both by aesthetic and technological goals. At the end of the 19th century, things changed dramatically. Scientists started being able to analyze composition, detect structure, and make a link between structure and properties. The subsequent 20th-century revolution in new materials changed almost all aspects of human activity. However, it was not without serious side-effects, the first of which has been that the materials science community has willingly marginalized itself. The second is the eradication of interest in the sensual and aesthetic properties of materials, and thus the banishment of the creative urges that arrive via the senses. This paper discusses these issues, and suggests that collaboration with the materials arts community offers exciting new challenges and could create an intellectual community that is not just more culturally and ethically aware, but also nurtures more innovative science.\", \"In general, old documents and records which eventually form the basic material for writing history of science, initiation and evolution of various disciplines of science, establishment and growth of science institutions, science education, science ministries or councils and biographical materials of notable peers in science will form science archive.\\nIn India, With hundreds of University Science departments, over a hundred well established research institutes, numerous science ministries and Councils of scientific research, science archives have Vast prospects.

Manufacturing is transforming into shorter design cycles, mass customization, on-demand production, and sustainable products. Additive manufacturing or 3D printing is a popular example of such a trend. However, the success of this manufacturing transformation is critically dependent on the availability of suitable materials and of data on invertible processing-structure-property-performance life cycle linkages of materials. Experience suggests that the material development cycle, i.e. the time to develop and deploy new material, generally exceeds the product design and development cycle. Hence, there is a need to accelerate materials innovation in order to keep up with product and manufacturing innovations. This is a major challenge considering the hundreds of thousands of materials and processes, and the huge amount of data on microstructure, composition, properties, and functional, environmental, and economic performance of materials. Moreover, the data sharing culture among the materials community is sparse. Materials informatics is key to the necessary transformation in product design and manufacturing.

E-learning materials can be a useful addition to the learning process since they help to explain the real world around us. Nearly two years have passed since we prepared e-learning materials for 3rd grade of primary school (including topics with physics basics) in the frame of the national project. Children are encouraged to study the materials and conduct the experiments. Teachers who have used our materials in classes are very satisfied and would like to use additional learning materials prepared in the same way. They think that the materials are useful as a part of school lessons, but not exclusively as complete lectures. Suitable proportion of experimental work combined with E-learning materials is the key to successful parallel development of natural science and digital competences. Teachers and their students have used the materials frequently during the whole period until now.

To become well-started beginning elementary teachers capable of engaging their students in inquiry-based science, preservice elementary teachers need to learn to use science curriculum materials effectively. Thus far, few other studies have investigated how preservice elementary teachers adapt science curriculum materials to better reflect five essential features of inquiry-based teaching and learning articulated in contemporary science education reform. Findings from previous research suggest that preservice elementary teachers can productively adapt science curriculum materials to make them more inquiry-based. The mixed-methods study presented here extends these findings by illustrating the essential features of inquiry preservice teachers emphasize in their curricular adaptations and the specific types of adaptations the preservice teachers make. Results suggest that the preservice teachers consistently attended to all five essential features of inquiry in their curricular adaptations. The types of adaptations that they made to promote each of these features of inquiry provide insight into their curriculum design practices and learning about science as inquiry that can serve as important leverage points for teacher education experiences and curriculum materials designed to support elementary teachers' science teaching practice and learning.

Thus chemical education is challenged to embrace the so called 'super sciences' currently designated as materials science and bio-molecular science, which are now widely believed to be the dominant forces in scientific discovery. However, it is debatable whether chemical education has sufficiently advanced to embrace the diffusion of chemistry into the super sciences. It is evident that the traditional boundaries of chemical education have already diffused so as to reveal how core chemical concepts can be interpreted in terms of the connection between chemical reactivity and human activity. Also, chemical education supports the promotion of chemistry as a sustainable science primarily through the teaching of 'green chemistry' and the influence of chemistry in sustaining the environment.

In order to use curriculum materials effectively, however, teachers must develop a robust capacity for pedagogical design, or the ability to mobilize a variety of personal and curricular resources to promote student learning. The purpose of this study was to develop a better understanding of the ways in which preservice elementary teachers mobilize and adapt existing science curriculum materials to plan inquiry-oriented science lessons. Using quantitative methods, we investigated preservice teachers' curriculum design decision-making and how their decisions influenced the inquiry orientations of their planned science lessons. Findings indicate that preservice elementary teachers were able to accurately assess how inquiry-based existing curriculum materials are and to adapt them to make them more inquiry-based. However, the inquiry orientations of their planned lessons were in large part determined by how inquiry-oriented curriculum materials they used to plan their lessons were to begin with. These findings have important implications for the design of teacher education experiences that foster preservice elementary teachers' pedagogical design capacities for inquiry, as well as the development of inquiry-based science curriculum materials that support preservice and beginning elementary teachers to engage in effective science teaching practice.

Building accelerators was LBL's stock-in-trade. Yet with the Advanced Light Source (ALS) nothing proceeded as in the past. Whereas nuclear and high energy physicists had been happy when funding was procured for new machines, materials scientists were irritated to learn that Shirley had brokered a deal with Presidential Science Advisor George Keyworth to fund the ALS. Materials scientists valued accelerators less because materials science had benefitted less from large-scale devices; such devices were therefore uncommon in their field. The project also faced competition and the criticism that LBL managers wanted it only to help their laboratory weather the threatening times that came with Ronald Reagan and his promise to cut the size of government ( and in fact that was a part of the rationale). The ALS also suffered because Shirley's deal was ill-suited for Washington in the 1980s. Scientists were less influential than in previous decades and a more robust federal bureaucracy controlled funding. Other ALS advocates eventually crafted a convincing scientific justification, recruited potential users, and guided the proposal through materials science reviews and the proper Washington channels. Although one-on-one deal making la Ernest Lawrence was a relic of the past, Shirley did bargain collectively with other directors, paving the way for ALS funding and a retooling of the national laboratories and materials science: in the 1990s and 2000s the largest Department of Energy accelerators were devoted to materials science, not nuclear or high-energy physics.\", \"This paper is a brief introduction to the ferroelectric materials and their applications.

Rather than using them as written, however, teachers often evaluate and adapt curriculum materials. To effectively engage in this process of curriculum design, teachers need to develop robust pedagogical design capacity, or their ability to identify and mobilize requisite resources, both personal and material, to develop effective learning environments. However, beginning elementary teachers face many challenges in learning to engage in curriculum design for science. They often lack substantial subject matter knowledge, struggle to articulate scientific inquiry in practice, and experience teaching contexts in which science is deemphasized. These factors mediate teachers' interactions with curriculum materials. To explore how elementary teachers learn to engage in curriculum design for science, three beginning elementary teachers were studied longitudinally over their first three years of professional teaching. Results show that the three teachers engaged in a substantial degree of curriculum design, drawing on a myriad of curriculum materials and modifying them to craft their own science curriculum materials. Their curriculum design efforts were influenced by their own views of science teaching, but also by features of their unique curricular contexts. Ultimately, alignment between the teachers' views and the curriculum materials they used, as well as opportunities to engage in iterative cycles of curriculum design with a stable set of curriculum materials, were important in supporting their developing pedagogical design capacities. These findings have implications for the field's understanding of teacher learning along the teacher professional continuum and help inform research on teachers and teaching, as well as science teacher education and curriculum development.\", \"Selective protection of the porosity can be implemented in porous materials processing by using an organic polymer fill.

The specific aim for this study is to determine how school science in early years of schooling impacts on years 11 and 12 science studies in the areas of materials science, and subsequent further tertiary studies. Public education records were investigated to obtain post hoc enrolment data to establish trends and decline in enrolments in physics and chemistry in the final years of high school which revealed a trend in enrolments falling over a ten year period. The student population in science of physics and chemistry were not well prepared for future studies and are a challenge for students undertaking engineering and technology studies at a tertiary level.

This study was based on the premise that the interaction of the teacher with the curriculum materials determines what happens in the classroom. An interpretive approach was adopted and five experienced chemistry teachers in four senior secondary schools participated in this study. Classroom observations and interviews were used as research methods. The data analysis revealed that there were four components of PCK that led to teachers' adaptations of curriculum materials and they were knowledge of students' understanding of science, knowledge of assessment in science, knowledge of instructional strategies, and knowledge of science curriculum. Among these four components of PCK, knowledge of students' understanding of science and knowledge of assessment in science were the factors that most influenced teachers' adaptations of curriculum materials.

This integration requires sophisticated teaching that does not often happen. Educative curriculum materials - materials explicitly designed to support teacher and student learning - have been posited as a way to support teachers to achieve these ambitious goals, yet little is known about how elementary teachers actually use educative curriculum materials to support student engagement in science practices. To address this gap, this study investigated how five upper elementary teachers supported students to engage in science practices during an enactment of two curriculum units. Three of the teachers had units enhanced with educative features, informed by current research and reforms, while two of the teachers had units without these features. The teachers varied in how they supported students in the science practices of justifying predictions, constructing evidence-based claims, recording observations, and planning investigations. For example, some of the teachers with the educative features supported students in constructing evidence-based claims and justifying predictions in ways called for by the educative features.

Our study asked whether providing students with review materials and a means of assessing their degree of preparedness prior to matriculation influenced actual and perceived performance in 1st-year basic science courses. Methods: Didactic review materials in basic science subjects encountered in the 1st year were made available to prematriculants online. Access to materials for each subject was contingent upon completion of a pretest. Prematriculants were free to use the materials as they saw fit. Once students matriculated, performance in basic science subjects was compared between those who had accessed the materials and those who had not. Students who accessed the materials were also surveyed to determine if they perceived any benefit from their use. Results: More than half of matriculants chose to access the intervention materials. There was no significant difference in MCAT, prerequisite grade point average, or total grade point average between those students who chose to access the intervention materials and those who did not. Students who accessed the intervention materials reported gains in confidence in their ability to perform well in medical school. Those students who accessed the intervention materials had significantly higher examination scores in an early basic science course than those who did not.

We report on our study of a middle school curriculum called Project-Based Inquiry Science that has some design features that match well with the new directions in science education. To measure the impact of these materials, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in sixth grade science classrooms across 42 schools in an urban school district. We randomly assigned schools to either a treatment condition where teachers implemented the project-based science curriculum or a comparison condition where teachers implemented the district-adopted textbook. Teachers in both conditions received professional development on the Framework. Students who participated in the project-based science curriculum outperformed students in the comparison curriculum on outcome measures that were aligned to core science ideas and science practices in the Framework. Importantly, the results show that project-based curriculum materials that incorporate science practices along with disciplinary content can help students achieve next generation science learning outcomes when there is coherence with district guidance about instruction. The study findings suggest that curriculum materials, district involvement, and support for teachers' implementation of new forms of instruction are important for realizing the vision and key principles of the Framework in the context of a large and diverse urban school district.

Traditional experiments and computational modelling often consume tremendous time and resources and are limited by their experimental conditions and theoretical foundations. Thus, it is imperative to develop a new method of accelerating the discovery and design process for novel materials. Recently, materials discovery and design using machine learning have been receiving increasing attention and have achieved great improvements in both time efficiency and prediction accuracy. In this review, we first outline the typical mode of and basic procedures for applying machine learning in materials science, and we classify and compare the main algorithms. Then, the current research status is reviewed with regard to applications of machine learning in material property prediction, in new materials discovery and for other purposes. Finally, we discuss problems related to machine learning in materials science, propose possible solutions, and forecast potential directions of future research. By directly combining computational studies with experiments, we hope to provide insight into the parameters that affect the properties of materials, thereby enabling more efficient and target-oriented research on materials discovery and design.

Using visual computing, a multitude of different phenomena may now be studied, at various scales, dimensions, or using different modalities. This was simply impossible before. Visual computing techniques provide novel insights in order to understand complex material systems of interest, which is demonstrated by strongly rising number of new approaches, publishing new techniques for materials analysis and simulation. Outlining the proximity of materials science and visual computing, this state of the art report focuses on the intersection of both domains in order to guide research endeavors in this field. We provide a systematic survey on the close interrelations of both fields as well as how they profit from each other. Analyzing the existing body of literature, we review the domain of visual computing supported materials science, starting with the definition of materials science as well as material systems for which visual computing is frequently used. Major tasks for visual computing, visual analysis and visualization in materials sciences are identified, as well as simulation and testing techniques, which are providing the data for the respective analyses. We reviewed the input data characteristics and the direct and derived outputs, the visualization techniques and visual metaphors used, as well as the interactions and analysis workflows employed. All our findings are finally integrated in a cumulative matrix, giving insights about the different interrelations of both domains.

For this purpose, it is of great importance to understand the relationship between products, materials, manufacturing techniques and properties.\\nWe are surrounded by materials, materials are everywhere, and in fact all products are made by materials. Students, despite their short knowledge about this subject at the time they do this laboratory practice, can intuitively distinguish a hard material of a soft material, if a material is brittle or not, the type of the material used (if it is a metal, ceramic, polymer.), and even sometimes how are they made. This is basically the aim of the practice, try to understand manipulating different set of products which are the main families of materials, how many different class of materials exist, why some materials are used in products with specific purposes, which are the most relevant properties of these materials and how they are made.\\nThis practice has recently been implemented in the School of Engineering of Bilbao for the second year students attending \\\"Fundamental of Material Science\\\" subject.

In contrast, an emerging theme in modern materials science is the notion of intelligent design of materials. Pioneered by the pharmaceutical industry and adapted for the purposes of materials science and engineering, the combinatorial approach represents a watershed in the process of accelerated discovery, development and optimization of materials. To survey large compositional landscapes rapidly, thousands of compositionally varying samples may be synthesized, processed and screened in a single experiment. Recent developments have been aided by innovative rapid characterization tools, and by advanced materials synthesis techniques such as laser molecular beam epitaxy which can be used to perform parallel-processed design and control of materials down to the atomic scale.

Its rise as a material technology was made possible by the fact that string embraces a material way of thinking, one that is uniquely capable of binding together what is invisible with what is phenomenal to experience. String today thus signals the resurgence of a chemical revolution, which, in parallel to a modernity fashioned by a mechanical revolution, has created a material world that is capable of provoking attachments in ways once attributed to the mind. We are now readily inclined to think in terms of relations of affinity that pertain between materials; yet this material thinking has remained largely confined to the creative centers of art and science where it continues to provoke innovations at a material level. This article argues that social and historical disciplines and institutions that serve the transmission of much of socially efficacious knowledge have remained ignorant of this development of a new technological materiality, by continuing to reduce the material to a mechanical aide for ideas that alone are believed capable of drawing things together.\", \"The expanding scope of polyphosphazenes in materials science is described.

A summary of the research regarding the adequacies of student conceptions about the nature of science revealed inconsistent results. Although the majority of studies show that student understandings are less than desirable, there is research that indicates that student conceptions are acceptable.

This article examines 21st-century introductory anthropology publications, demonstrating how such works perpetuate religion-science myths and the notion that history has been replete with inevitable religion versus science warfare. In particular, this study reveals how such introductory materials propagate discord narratives associated with the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment.

Along with increased demand for medical grade materials, the medical device industry has renewed its awareness and concern for the safety of materials used. An essential part of establishing biological safety is the implementation of chemical and material characterization testing.\\nChemistry is often called the central science because of its role in connecting the physical sciences, which include chemistry, with the life sciences and applied sciences such as medicine and engineering. This role of chemistry as the central science is very important to medical device evaluations and is noticeably evident in the ISO 10993 approach to the biological safety evaluation of medical devices and biomaterials. Parts 18 and 19 of the 10993 series of standards are receiving even more emphasis, as they become an integral part of the biological evaluation of medical devices. An important step in the process is that of characterizing the material and identification of chemicals that can migrate or extract from the polymer components. Such basic information is critical to understanding the biological response and toxicological risk of the device since adverse effects caused by materials are generally chemical effects.\\nIn recent years there has been a great deal of discussion of the merits of chemical and material characterization.

The goal of the i-STEM institute was to enhance the participating educators' STEM content knowledge, capacity for teaching STEM, comfort and attitudes toward teaching STEM, knowledge of how people learn, and strategies for integrating STEM throughout the curriculum. In addition, the participants received STEM curriculum in materials science and a resource kit composed of STEM materials and equipment, valued at about $300, to support the implementation of curriculum and content learned at the institute with their students.\\nThe i-STEM summer institute participants were pre/post tested on their comfort with STEM, perceptions of STEM education, pedagogical discontentment, implementations of inquiry, attitudes toward student learning of STEM, and content knowledge associated with the specific course they took during the institute.

Our analysis revealed that the educative curriculum materials facilitated continued science learning, shaped and scaffolded teachers' pedagogical practices, and extended the PD while the teachers were immersed in the act of teaching. Furthermore, the interrelated project activities along with the involvement of school and district administrators offered the teachers ongoing support and provided multiple opportunities to develop, reinforce, and extend their understanding of the science content, teaching practices, and principles of the curriculum.

Much of the continuing discussion in the materials development community is therefore focused on the creation of novel materials innovation ecosystems designed to dramatically accelerate materials development efforts, while lowering the overall cost involved. In this paper, it is argued that the recent advances in data science can be leveraged suitably to address this challenge by effectively mediating between the seemingly disparate, inherently uncertain, multiscale and multimodal measurements and computations involved in the current materials' development efforts. Proper utilisation of modern data science in the materials' development efforts can lead to a new generation of data-driven decision support tools for guiding effort investment (for both measurements and computations) at various stages of the materials development. It should also be recognised that the success of such ecosystems is predicated on the creation and utilisation of integration platforms for promoting intimate, synchronous collaborations between cross-disciplinary and distributed team members (i.e. cyberinfrastructure). Indeed, data sciences and cyberinfrastructure form the two main pillars of the emerging new discipline broadly referred to as materials informatics (MI).

While initially the main applications of electron microscopy were thought to be in biology, in the event the applications in materials science were found to be equally important. The electron microscope has enabled the materials scientist not only to determine surface structure at higher resolution than is possible by optical microscopy, but also to see inside materials down to the atomic level. Over the last 40-50 years the TEM has undergone spectacular development; today it provides the materials scientist with a tool of great power and versatility, combining microscopy, diffraction and microanalytical facilities. The scanning electron microscope (SEM), which as a working instrument was developed rather later than the TEM, has also proved itself to be a powerful and indispensable tool in Materials Science. The impact of electron microscopy in materials science has been far-reaching. The microstructure of materials is highly complex, and can be modified by processing to provide suitable materials properties Direct observations of microstructures are essential in the development of the underlying science controlling properties, and of the processing routes necessary to achieve optimum properties.\", \"The scope of this article is to introduce the structure of scientific research in Japan with materials science as a main concern. A wide view of the organisms which are managing Japanese research is presented as well as the main projects.\", \"Recognizing the necessary social aspects of scientific knowledge leads to a serious shift in the analysis of science. Whereas until recently the study of scientific knowledge in terms of its social qualities began with its logical structure, today the primary focuses of analysis are the human brain, the material carrier of computer programs, the economic relations in the society of commodity production, and so forth. All of this is not science, but is involved in the production of new knowledge. The boundary between the spiritual and the material, between the scientific and nonscientific is blurred. To study this phenomenon, the vector of research shifts: social qualities are not sought in scientific knowledge, but the external world of non-science exhibits signs of the presence of the spiritual in the form of emerging scientific knowledge.\", \"Educative curriculum materials present a promising mechanism for promoting more ambitious science teaching in elementary classrooms, including engaging students in science practices. Integrating science practices with science content is emphasized in new education reforms. Elementary teachers, however, face challenges in engaging children in science practices such as scientific argumentation. We propose that the justification of predictions could serve as an entree to scientific argumentation in elementary grades. To support elementary teachers in integrating science content with science practice, including justifying predictions about scientific phenomena, we added educative features to 2 existing upper elementary inquiry science units, 1 on electric circuits and 1 on ecosystems. This article reports results from a large-scale, quasi-experimental study with 2 conditions: the treatment condition, in which teachers had educative features, and the comparison condition, in which teachers had the original curriculum materials. This study sought to characterize differences in students' written predictions with justification across condition and discipline. In the treatment condition, in which teachers were using the educative curriculum materials, the students' predictions with justification showed significantly greater improvement in quality scores from the preunit assessment to the postunit assessment compared to the comparison condition. In addition, there was more evidence of teacher support for justifying predictions in the collected notebooks and enactments in the treatment condition compared to the comparison condition. These findings have implications for curriculum developers and teacher educators, suggesting an important role for educative curriculum materials in promoting reforms in science education.\", \"Major advances have been made over the past 30 years in the development of an integrated computational materials design (ICMD) technology.

As part of an urban systemic reform effort, science materials were designed to reflect desired reforms and to support teacher thinking by addressing necessary content, pedagogy, and pedagogical content knowledge for teachers. The goal of this research was to describe teachers' enactments in comparison to reform as instantiated in the materials. Four middle school teachers' initial enactment of an inquiry-based science unit on force and motion were analyzed. Findings indicate two teachers' enactments were consistent with intentions and two teachers' enactments were not. However, enactment ratings for the first two were less reflective of curriculum intent when challenges were greatest, such as when teachers attempted to present challenging science ideas, respond to students' ideas, structure investigations, guide small-group discussions, or make adaptations. Overall, findings suggest that purposefully using materials with detailed lesson descriptions and specific, consistent supports for teacher thinking can help teachers with enactment. However, materials alone are not sufficient; reform efforts must include professional development and efforts to create systemic change in context and policy to support teacher learning and classroom enactment.

Our findings reveal that teacher supports, rather than student supports, had positive impacts on both student and teacher outcomes. Specifically, positive student outcomes were associated with curriculum materials with a larger scope and with materials that provide teachers with information about students' ideas and recommended instructional strategies. Positive teacher outcomes were associated with the presence of information about targeted standards and recommended instructional strategies. Relatively fewer studies reported on teacher outcomes, and evidence about other dimensions of curriculum materials impact (e.g., spread, sustainability) was difficult to find. Overall, these results reveal the broad importance of embedding teacher supports and ensuring sufficient scope of content across coordinated curriculum units to support the development of conceptual understanding over time.

Designing instruction for students is shaped by teachers' ability to apply a variety of personal resources, including their pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). This study investigated a criterion-based approach to lesson plan analysis as one way to help preservice elementary teachers develop and use their PCK to plan instruction for students. Results show that the preservice teachers demonstrated a range of strengths and weaknesses in applying their knowledge of science assessment, science curriculum materials, and instructional strategies for teaching science. This range was influenced, in part, by the presence of alternative ideas about science teaching, the extent to which the original curriculum materials aligned with reform-based standards and practices, and the presence of prompts to use criteria in their analyses. Despite these factors, preservice teachers' PCK improved significantly over time when they had multiple opportunities to practice applying the same criterion in their analyses.

Many subjects are not easily understood by students, especially on materials that teach some theories about natural processes. Such as rain process, condensation and many other processes. The difficulty that students experience in understanding it is that students cannot imagine the things that have been taught in the material. Although there is material to practice some theories but is actually quite limited. There is also a video or simulation material in the form of 2D animated images. Understanding concepts in natural science lessons are also poorly understood by students. Natural Science learning media uses 3-dimensional animation models (3D) with augmented reality technology, which offers some visualization of science lessons. This application was created to visualize a process in Natural Science subject matter. The hope of making this application is to improve student's concept. This app is made to run on a personal computer that comes with a webcam with augmented reality. The app will display a 3D animation if the camera can recognize the marker.\", \"One of the most powerful techniques to extract physical and chemical information of a material is the light scattering. Opposite to x-ray scattering for instance, where an average of the sample properties is obtained, Raman scattering is a local probe which can be used to detect inhomogeneities, local strain, lack of crystallinity, anharmonicities or information on the electronic structure by means of resonant Raman scattering. In this work, we will analyze the main contributions of Raman scattering in Materials Sciences. After a brief introduction of the technique and the equipment needed for the physical measurements, we will give practical examples of Raman scattering measurements applied to a number of materials and the valuable information obtained in every example.

Based on the facts that it would be impossible to carry out a serious discussion deeply with such a broad view, we secondly adopt a narrower viewpoint. Unlike most of the papers focusing on the multiscale problems in chemistry or materials science, we will emphasize the issues in data analysis of complex physiological systems where the multiscale character is the dominating role and is exploited innovatively.

Developing countries, including Ghana, are not able to provide teachers with instructional resources for teaching and learning due to financial constraints. Science in particular is a subject that pupils and students in Ghana generally do not perform well both at the basic and senior high levels which is evident from the end of level examinations over the years. The study used exploratory and descriptive approaches under qualitative research. Convenience sampling was used to select low cost and waste materials to work with, and observation was used to collect data from the production process. The research found that waste materials can be used safely to develop appropriate and useful instructional resources that are very practical for teaching and learning of science lessons. This research projects to science teachers that they can freely turn collected waste and low-cost materials into useful resources for effective lessons.\", \"This paper presents an epistemological analysis of typical didactical activities noted in early-years science lessons, which was carried out in an attempt to diagnose the extent to which the teaching practices adopted by early-years educators are successful in supporting young children's understanding in science. The analysis of didactical activities used a framework that allowed us to discover whether they promoted desired connections between theoretical ideas, evidence and the material world. Theoretical ideas, evidence and the material world are entities internal to scientific inquiry and, in educational contexts, connections between them are considered essential in assisting the development of young children's scientific thinking. The results indicated that in the early-years science classroom scientific activity was mainly confined to the representational level. Intervention practices into the material world were limited, and were based on collected evidence. No interventions based on ideas were identified in the science lessons. Missing links between evidence and theory and between ideas and the material world suggest that the didactical activities analysed did not promote scientific understanding.\", \"The committees for the current Dutch context-based innovation in secondary science education employed teachers to design context-based curriculum materials. A study on the learning of science teachers in design teams for context-based curriculum materials is presented in this paper. In a correlation study, teachers with (n = 25 and 840 students) and without (n = 8 and 184 students) context-based curriculum material design experience were compared on contextbased competence. Context-based competence comprises context handling, regulation, emphasis, design, and school innovation. Context-based teaching competence was mapped using both qualitative and quantitative research methods in a composite instrument. Due to the differences in design team set-up for different science subjects, teachers with design experience from different science subjects were also compared on their context-based competence. It was found that teachers with design experience showed more context-based competence than their non-designing colleagues. Furthermore, teachers designing for biology showed more context-based competence than their peers from other science subjects.\", \"Nitrogen-doped (N-doped) graphene has attracted increasing attentions because of the significantly enhanced properties in physic, chemistry, biology and material science, as compared with those of pristine graphene.

Curriculum materials are often the main means by which these science practices and canonical knowledge are incorporated into lessons. As part of a 5-year longitudinal research and design project at a large university in the USA, faculty developed an elementary science methods course for pre-service elementary teachers. As a result the pre-service elementary teachers come to understand the Learning Cycle framework as support mechanism for science instruction. This study examined pre-service elementary teachers' use of curriculum materials in lesson planning by identifying types of instructional tools used during the Learning Cycle. Findings highlight the importance of providing pre-service elementary teachers with supportive frameworks and opportunities to learn to critique and adapt curriculum materials in order to begin the development of their pedagogical design capacity for Learning Cycle lessons.\", \"We report on findings of a project to improve student learning in a university-level introductory materials science course for engineers. In a related preparatory project, we identified student difficulties with basic topics in materials science through interviews and/or testing of over 1000 students at The Ohio State University. Here, we report on the implementation of concept oriented group-work lessons or \\\"tutorials\\\" designed to address student difficulties identified in our prior work and improve student understanding of core concepts in materials science. The lessons were designed for weekly 48 minute recitations in which students work together in small groups on the tutorials in the presence of teaching assistants who assess and facilitate student progress. To determine the learning outcome, we analyzed scores on the final exam and found that even accounting for the fact that slightly \\\"better\\\" students tended to attend recitations more often, there was a valued-added effect of the recitations on final exam performance. These results suggest that these recitation methods and materials are effective in teaching students the difficult and important conceptual materials which they were designed to address.\", \"The key stumbling block to serious consideration of homeopathy is the presumed \\\"implausibility\\\" of biological activity for homeopathic medicines in which the source material is diluted past Avogadro's number of molecules. Such an argument relies heavily on the assumptions of elementary chemistry (and biochemistry), in which the material composition of a solution, (dilution factors and ligand-receptor interactions), is the essential consideration. In contrast, materials science focuses on the three-dimensional complex network structure of the condensed phase of water itself, rather than the original solute molecules. The nanoheterogenous structure of water can be determined by interactive phenomena such as epitaxy (the transmission of structural information from the surface of one material to another without the transfer of any matter), temperature-pressure processes during succussion, and formation of colloidal nanobubbles containing gaseous inclusions of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and possibly the remedy source material. Preliminary data obtained using Raman and Ultra-Violet-Visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy illustrate the ability to distinguish two different homeopathic medicines (Nux vomica and Natrurn muriaticum) from one another and to differentiate, within a given medicine, the 6c, 12c, and 30c potencies. Materials science concepts and experimental tools offer a new approach to contemporary science, for making significant advances in the basic science studies of homeopathic medicines.\", \"This critical review of the published literature on dental materials for the year 1996 has been compiled by the Dental Materials Panel of the UK.

Hence a new course linking mechanics, materials science and design has been developed. The course, titled 'Mechanics and Materials in Structural Design', educates students in the total design of structures. One important aspect of this approach to teaching is to develop multimedia-based virtual laboratory modules. This paper focuses on one such module, namely the 'tension test of metals' module. This module links the mechanics experiment with the fundamentals of materials science and highlights its usefulness in generating design information. With this approach to teaching, using an apparently simple tension test, the students can better visualize the linkages between mechanics, materials response at the macro and atomic levels, and design. Preliminary evaluation of the course suggests that this philosophy of teaching an integrated course on design is valid.\", \"The materials science of carbon-based materials has enjoyed a tremendous growth in the past half century.

We provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of the most recent research in this topic. As a starting point, we introduce machine learning principles, algorithms, descriptors, and databases in materials science. We continue with the description of different machine learning approaches for the discovery of stable materials and the prediction of their crystal structure. Then we discuss research in numerous quantitative structure-property relationships and various approaches for the replacement of first-principle methods by machine learning. We review how active learning and surrogate-based optimization can be applied to improve the rational design process and related examples of applications.

A sufficient number and variety of teaching materials aims at different learning skills of the students and meets the diversity of a first year class. Therefore teaching materials and micro-module lectures to individually chose, combine and study from a distance are provided in a newly established moodle-based course. Along with exercises and worked solutions, students can check their learning progress via selftesting. Peer instruction (Simon et al., 2010) is used to assess the learning progress prior to each class. In blended-learning scenarios students use different materials to study and understand the science in theory and then the classroom lectures offer the opportunity for students to comprehend the principle of different aspects in material science and apply their knowledge. Not all of the themes taught the first semester are suitable to apply the inverted classroom approach, but it has been proven to be successful and increase the fun of teaching throughout the first year.

Getting your hands dirty in the messy worlds of the laboratory and the storage room, and getting entangled with the commemorative practices of scientists and technicians does not belong to the common experiences of students in history and philosophy of science. Despite the recent material turn in cultural studies, students' engagement with the material world often remains a linguistic exercise, extending at most to an excursion to the sanitised and academically encultured world of the museum exhibit.\\nI contrast this approach by drawing on experiences of taking students to the Atomei, Germany's oldest research reactor at the Garching campus of the Munich University of Technology. Decommissioned since 2000, the installation and its history are still controlled by scientists. Studying contemporary laboratories and their materiality has so far been the domain of sociologists and ethnographers. I argue for opening these spaces to historians of science and engaging with the 'unfinished' material world of contemporary science. Taking the material seriously beyond the linguistic turn and asking students to explore laboratories and other sites of knowledge production challenges existing histories and historiographies. By exploring local university departments and their recent histories through their material heritage, we can observe everyday science and confront scientists and technicians' cultures with those of historians'. By engaging with recent material heritage as historians and archivists, students can make an important contribution to enhancing the awareness about this heritage, its implications for history writing, as well as its documentation and preservation.

All levitators (e.g., aerodynamic, acoustic, electromagnetic, electrostatic, optical) have their own merits and limitations but the electrostatic scheme offers the combined advantages of processing millimeter-size objects, independent heating, quasi-spherical shape of molten materials, handling of materials under extreme temperatures for hours, virtually convection-free samples, and wide view around the samples for diagnostic.

As a result, elementary teachers must often adapt their science curriculum materials to better support students' explanation construction and foster student sense making. However, little research has been conducted to explore if and, if so, how and why, elementary teachers modify science curriculum materials to engage students in explanation construction. We use an embedded mixed methods research design to explore elementary teachers' (n=45) curricular adaptations and pedagogical reasoning. We collected and quantitatively analyzed a matched set of 121 elementary science lesson plans and video recorded lesson enactments to investigate the extent to which inservice elementary teachers engage in instruction to more productively support students' explanation construction. Our findings suggest that the curriculum materials heavily emphasized hands-on engagement and data collection over explanation construction and that the teachers' adaptations did not fundamentally alter scientific sense-making opportunities afforded students in the lesson plans. Interviews and other artifacts were also collected and analyzed to construct a multiple-case study of four of these elementary teachers. Findings from the case study suggest that the teachers' conceptions of explanation construction and concerns about the abilities of their students to engage in scientific explanations impacted their curricular adaptations.

Some argue that restructuring and downsizing result in journalists coming under increased pressure to produce copy, leading them to use more public relations material to meet their deadlines. This article explores science journalism in the highly commercialised media market of New Zealand. Using semi-structured interviews with scientists, science communication advisors and journalists, the study finds communication advisors and scientists believe most media outlets, excluding public service media, report science poorly. Furthermore, restructuring and staff cuts have placed the journalists interviewed under increasing pressure.

Science-technology-society (STS) curricula that give science an accessible social context have developed in response, but controversy surrounds the extent to which students should be introduced to socioscientific debate. Using material from a case study of Salters' Advanced Chemistry in the United Kingdom, this article demonstrates how socioscientific material is marginalized through the structures and language of syllabus texts and through classroom practices. This means students are unlikely to engage with socioscientific aspects in their course. Socioscientific content is gendered through association with social concerns and epistemological uncertainty, and because gender is asymmetric, socioscience is devalued with respect to the masculinity of abstract science. Teachers fear that extensive coverage of socioscience devalues the curriculum, alienates traditional science students and jeopardizes their own status as gatekeepers of scientific knowledge. Thus, although STS curricula such as Salters' offer potential for making science more accessible, the article concludes that greater awareness of, and challenges to, gender binaries could result in more effective STS curriculum reform.

As such, engaging with the materiality of that world is integral to both empirical experimentation and theorising within science. However, it has been recognised for some time that the way scientists learn about the world and the way that young people learn about science cannot be simply equated. This difference has been pronounced in recent decades by the dominance of constructivist and social-constructivist theories of learning, which focus on the development of concepts in the minds of people. Whilst these theories have yielded insight into the complexity of learning, the role of the material remains undertheorised, not only within practical science inquiry, but also in relation to the broader materiality of classrooms. Through a detailed critical literature review, this paper demonstrates the need for a stronger theoretical frame through which to understand the role of the material in the learning and pedagogy of science. Building upon the gaps and possibilities that this review reveals, we outline a new material-dialogic theory via a synthesis of Barad's Agential Realism and Bakhtinian dialogic theory.

In this paper, we present a learning-goals-driven design model for developing curriculum materials, which combines national standards and a project-based pedagogical approach. We describe our design model in the context of the Investigating and Questioning our World through Science and Technology (IQWST) project, which is developing a three-year coordinated series of middle grades science curriculum materials. From using this model in the development and enactment of the curriculum, we identified three important characteristics: unpacking national science standards, developing a learning performances approach to specifying teaming goals, and aligning learning goals, instructional activities, and assessments. Using a case study of an IQWST unit from initial development through two cycles of enactment, we describe how these three characteristics help guide curriculum design, identify design issues in curriculum enactments, and guide the development of design solutions. The iterative use of the learning-goals-driven design model coupled with the analysis of multiple data sources informed our revision of the curriculum materials, resulting in substantial student learning gains for the targeted science content and scientific inquiry learning goals.

As such, many engineering education programmes have developed curriculum materials that are being used in K-12 settings. However, little is known about the nature and extent to which engineering design skills outlined in NGSS are addressed in these K-12 engineering education programme curriculum materials. We analysed nine K-12 engineering education programmes for the nature and extent of engineering design skills coverage. Results show that developing possible solutions and actual designing of prototypes were the highly covered engineering design skills; specification of clear goals, criteria, and constraints received medium coverage; defining and identifying an engineering problem; optimising the design solution; and demonstrating how a prototype works, and making iterations to improve designs were lowly covered. These trends were similar across grade levels and across discipline-specific curriculum materials.

To answer this question, the aim of present study was to determine the effects of a natural disaster on progress in materials science research. The Tsunami event in Japan and materials science are well suited to serve as a case study for both the development and application of a system to evaluate the Academic Research Output immediately after a natural disaster. In particular, the analysis focused on the short-term impacts of Japan's triple disaster - earthquake, Tsunami, and nuclear accident (11 March, 2011) - on the Academic Research Output in materials science subject from three different areas: Sendai (Miyagi Prefecture), Tsukuba (Ibaraki Prefecture) and Kyoto (Kyoto Prefecture). The last one has been used as an internal reference standard (normal/non-disaster situation) for the comparison. A geographical cluster-based study was conducted between 09 February and 10 April 2011. Consistent with the hypothesis that a disaster might slow down knowledge production, the conclusion showed that the Japan's triple disaster strongly influenced the Academic Research Output of papers in the selected field of science.

The critical features of science texts are their multiple representations, such as text and visual elements, which assist the representation of science concepts. A multimedia learning environment can present relevant materials in various formats and help students to process the materials in meaningful ways, for example, by integrating learning materials with relevant prior concepts, and organizing them into a consistent and coherent cognitive structure. However, some issues with multimedia instructional design have been proposed, such as students' cognitive load and learning motivations. In this study, an augmented reality-based science learning system was developed based on the contiguity principle of multimedia learning in order to promote students' science learning. Moreover, an experiment was conducted on a natural science course in an elementary school to assess the effectiveness of the implemented system on students' learning.

The geosciences have always been interdisciplinary, depending heavily on an understanding of the basic and associated sciences. The geology faculty and graduate students at the University of Wyoming were surveyed to determine their use of the information resources in the Science Library to ascertain their use of interdisciplinary science materials. Their responses indicated that they did not use extensively the major reference resources or indexing/abstracting resources in the major science disciplines other than geology. They did use the broadly based general science journals, particularly Science and Nature, and displayed great variation and individual interests in the non-geology subject-focused journals they used. The geochemists visited the Science Library and used the resources more frequently than did geologists in any of the other geology disciplines.

Building on this framework, I focus on the production process in which materials, namely bioplastics, are produced and are transformed into products and so material-product relationships are formed, and new materials are substituted with existing ones. As such this study shows that actually products make materials as well, and that properties of materials are not intrinsic to them so as to be to chosen by designers, but that properties of materials are partly made in relation to the products into which they are made.\", \"Synchrotron radiation is well suited for many experimental applications in materials science.

The emerged materials ontologies, most of which are designed manually, provide useful but relatively limited materials knowledge. In contrast, Linked Open Data (LOD) provides some huge open knowledge bases in which lots of materials knowledge is hidden. Therefore, we try to derive an ontology about metallic materials domain from Yago which is a well-known open knowledge base. In this paper, an approach is proposed to generate metallic materials ontology based on the structure of Yago and string matching algorithm. First, we define keywords to initially obtain some metallic materials concepts from Yago by string matching algorithm. Then, based on these obtained concepts, the metallic materials knowledge and related knowledge is extracted according to the structural features of Yago, so as to acquire a metallic materials ontology (named MMOY). The detailed extraction strategy is elaborated as a set of logic rules designed for our approach. The approach is evaluated in light of F1-measure and time performance, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can extract metallic materials knowledge and related knowledge from Yago effectively, and the time performance is acceptable. In addition, we have developed a prototype system to visually demonstrate the knowledge structure of MMOY. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Once the material has been detected and secured, the questions on the intended use, the radiological hazard and the origin of the material need to be answered. Classical forensic techniques address the criminalistic part of the case, i.e., the identification of the suspect criminal. The phenomenon of nuclear smuggling and illicit trafficking of nuclear material has led to the development of a new branch of science: nuclear forensics. The key issue is the identification of the origin of the material, in order to improve the physical protection measures and prevent future thefts or diversions. The key challenge is the specificity and complexity of the nuclear area and the particular requirements for handling such material. Nuclear forensic science makes use of analytical techniques that were actually developed for applications related to the nuclear fuel cycle, hence appropriate and safe handling of the samples during the investigations is assured. For interpretation of the results, nuclear forensic science relies to a large extent on the expertise and experience of the investigating scientists.

Advanced materials ventures are a sparsely studied type of science-based business, though sufficiently different from others, such as biotech, to merit individual study. What strategies do advanced materials ventures use to overcome their daunting commercialization challenges? To address this question, this paper draws on literature on value creation and advanced materials commercialization, and presents new evidence from a sample of 43 advanced materials ventures from three countries. Through a hierarchical cluster analysis, the sample is subdivided into nanomaterials, performance materials, and fuel cell ventures and sub-group commercialization characteristics are described and compared.

Our findings suggest that embracing uncertainty enhances value creation for nanomaterials and performance materials ventures but can diminish value creation for ventures commercializing fuel cell technologies. Successful firms commercializing nanomaterials and performance materials leveraged the generic nature of their technologies to achieve higher value creation, but tailored the technology to each target market. In contrast, successful fuel cell firms integrated further forward along their value chains and standardized their products across target markets.\", \"This paper applies air material operation rare formulas to establish air material inventory model before genetic algorithm is applied to solve it.

In a previous study, we developed and tested a survey instrument designed to measure preservice elementary teachers' development of curricular role identity for science teaching through their use of science curriculum materials. In this follow-up study, a revised version of the survey was administered to a second group of preservice elementary teachers in the same science methods course, and data were analyzed within and across years. Results from this study suggest that preservice teachers articulated important similarities and differences between the curricular role identities for science teaching they attributed to themselves and to more experienced elementary teachers. Over time, they were often able to begin to appropriate the curricular role identities for science teaching that they attributed to more experienced elementary teachers. However, findings from the second survey administration also suggest that preservice teachers' curricular role identities for science teaching are more stable when characterized by their actual curriculum design practices than when characterized by comparative, probabilistic means. These findings have important implications for science teacher education and curriculum development, as well as the operationalization of curricular role identity in education research.\", \"We introduce atomate, an open-source Python framework for computational materials science simulation, analysis, and design with an emphasis on automation and extensibility.

The authors then describe ways in which both theoretical perspectives and empirical data guided their design, development, and refinement process for educative features to enhance the curriculum materials, and give examples of the resulting features. Given the current policy environment in which there are heightened expectations for science teaching at the elementary level, the authors argue that testing and refining processes for developing curricular supports for teachers is of paramount importance. While the illustrations provided focus on science curriculum materials and instruction, the authors argue that the principles and processes applied generalize to the design of educative features across subject-matter areas.\", \"The development of modern materials science has led to a growing need to understand the phenomena determining the properties of materials and processes on an atomistic level.

We focused on three aspects of NOS: the creative, the empirical, and the inferential NOS. The trade books were read aloud by teachers in three hierarchical levels: Level I served as a control and consisted of a trade book that remained unmodified, Level II consisted of a trade book that had been modified to include explicit references to NOS, and Level III consisted of a modified trade book accompanied by educative curriculum materials that were aimed at improving the teachers' views of NOS as well as supporting teaching about NOS. We used the Views of Nature of Science Questionnaire-form CE (VNOS-CE) preintervention and postintervention to determine changes in teachers' views of NOS and interviews preintervention and postintervention to determine changes in students' views. Audio recordings of read-alouds were used to determine changes in teaching practice, including the frequency and the quality (i.e., naive or informed) of the NOS references in the discussions. Interviews were used to determine teachers' perceptions of the modified trade books and educative curriculum materials. We found that both teachers and students developed more informed views of the targeted NOS aspects after the intervention and that teachers addressed NOS more often, and in a more informed manner, when they had trade books that explicitly supported NOS instruction and educative curriculum materials that supported their learning about NOS. Furthermore, they perceived the intervention materials favorably. Teachers' views and practices were able to change in tandem because of the intervention materials that supported explicit NOS instruction. We highlight the need for more widespread development of similar educative curriculum materials.\", \"This paper introduces the concept of ecological environment material, its relationship with the society and its classification as well as application of several kinds of typical ecological environment materials.

Such knowledge bases can be used for multiple tasks, such as question answering, exploring research hypotheses and identifying opportunities for new research. Linguistically complex constructs are used to express CE relations in text, which requires complex natural language processing techniques for CE relation extraction. In this paper, we propose two machine learning techniques for automatically extracting CE relation mentions from documents in metallurgy and materials science domains. We show experimentally that our algorithms outperform several baselines for extracting intra-sentence CE relation mentions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for extraction of CE relations from documents in metallurgy and materials science domains.\", \"Experimental research in both medical sciences and material science rely in many situations on a reduced quantity of available data, due to limited number of patients or high costs of samples.

The particular materials considered are metal polymers and nonmagnetic materials.\", \"A brief overview of the contributions which Mossbauer effect spectroscopy has made to areas of materials science is presented. A survey of the literature reveals the decreasing trends of established areas, with emergence in the past decade or so of new areas such as nanostructured materials and materials produced by mechanochemical treatment and the continuing importance of rare-earth magnetic materials. Examples of applications of Fe-57 and Sn-119 Mossbauer spectroscopy, both transmission and backscattering, are discussed.

The active polymeric material is a filled poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) elastomer that is covalently functionalized with spiropyran (SP), which is both a photochemical and mechanochemical switch. The material can be reversibly changed from colorless to dark purple by exposing it to light from a blue laser pointer or providing a mechanical stimulus such as hitting the polymer with a hammer or dragging a blunt object across the surface. The keynote demonstration is a PDMS chemical-drawing board that allows children literally to \\\"write without ink\\\" using a laser pointer or a blunt stylus. Collectively, these demonstrations are suitable for various student groups and encompass concepts in polymer and materials chemistry, photochemistry, and mechanochemistry. This demonstration has been successfully employed dozens of times in multiple universities across North America.\", \"A major challenge in foundational science courses in dental curricula is the application of information from the classroom to a clinical setting. To bridge this gap, the aim of this study was to increase students' learning in a foundational pharmacology course through increasing clinical relevance and using formative assessment. Second-year dental students in an introductory pharmacology course were presented material in a traditional basic science lecture format, and in brief examples of pharmacy generated clinical content (Medication Minutes). Short-term retention was assessed with a series of five post-class session, non-graded quizzes, each containing four questions: two knowledge-based (one from basic science material and one Medication Minute) and two application-based (one from basic science material and one Medication Minute). Ten knowledge-based (basic science material) questions and ten application-based (Medication Minutes) questions were included on exams throughout the semester. The primary outcome was to measure long-term retention using performance on these questions on an assessment the following semester. Additionally, the impact of student engagement on examination performance was evaluated based on the number of quizzes each student completed. Students who completed three or more quizzes (n=43, 53%) were designated as \\\"highly engaged,\\\" while students who completed less than three quizzes (n=36, 44%) were defined as \\\"less engaged.\\\" Two students (3%) were excluded for not completing the long-term assessment or not consenting to the study. On short-term retention measures, the students performed better on the Medication Minute (M=0.76) than basic science (M=0.58) (p<0.001) material; however, on the in-semester examinations, there was no difference in performance. On long-term retention measures, the students performed better on Medication Minute material (M=0.64) than basic science material (M=0.33) (p<0.001); this was true for both highly engaged and less-engaged students. These results suggest that teaching pharmacology in a clinical context yielded better long-term retention than teaching with a non-clinical focus.\", \"The year 2006 was declared a national \\\"Year of Computer Science\\\" by the German Minister of Education and Research.

My personal involvement in this field started in the very early 1960s. And I remember being asked to join the Honorary Advisory Board of a journal to be entitled Journal of Materials Science, a few years after that, namely in 1965/66. I thought it a very good idea of Robert Cahn at the time and have been pleased to remain associated with the journal ever since. Since those days the field of composite science has expanded enormously and lately with Carl Zweben I edited, as General Editor, a six volume work on the science and technology of composites entitled Comprehensive Composite Materials. In what follows I have set down a summary of the field of composites engendered by my editing of that comprehensive work adding some history of how the field arose and including some pointers to the future.

The researchers use cataloging dates from bibliographic records in the Research Libraries Information Network (RLIN) to measure the difference in processing times among selected research libraries with centralized technical services operations. A random sample of monographic titles from the 1988 catalogs of publishers of high-quality research materials is coded for the broad areas of humanities, social sciences, and science; these titles are then searched in RLIN to identify cataloging dates. The cataloging date is an imperfect indicator of availability, but it is a strong measure of overall technical processing performance. The average processing time per title is used to test whether processing times in this sample vary significantly by discipline. It was found that science materials were processed more slowly (mean 152.9 days) than materials in the social sciences (mean 130.7 days) and the humanities (mean 100.7 days).\", \"In the context of 1960s research on biological membranes, scientists stumbled upon a curiously coloured material substance, which became called the \\\"purple membrane.\\\" Interactions with the material as well as chemical analyses led to the conclusion that the microbial membrane contained a photoactive molecule similar to rhodopsin, the light receptor of animals' retinae. Until 1975, the find led to the formation of novel objects in science, and subsequently to the development of a field in the molecular life sciences that comprised biophysics, bioenergetics as well as membrane and structural biology. Furthermore, the purple membrane and bacteriorhodopsin, as the photoactive membrane transport protein was baptized, inspired attempts at hybrid bio-optical engineering throughout the 1980s. A central motif of the research field was the identification of a functional biological structure, such as a membrane, with a reactive material substance that could be easily prepared and manipulated. Building on this premise, early purple membrane research will be taken as a case in point to understand the appearance and transformation of objects in science through work with material substances. Here, the role played by a perceptible material and its spontaneous change of colour, or reactivity, casts a different light on objects and experimental practices in the late twentieth century molecular life sciences. With respect to the impact of chemical working and thinking, the purple membrane and rhodopsins represent an influential domain straddling the life and chemical sciences as well as bio- and material technologies, which has received only little historical and philosophical attention. Re-drawing the boundary between the living and the non-enlivened, these researches explain and model organismic activity through the reactivity of macromolecular structures, and thus palpable material substances.\", \"Materials design and discovery can be represented as selecting the optimal structure from a space of candidates that optimizes a target property. Since the number of candidates can be exponentially proportional to the structure determination variables, the optimal structure must be obtained efficiently.

Findings revealed that the ways in which the 6 teachersenacted the discussion reflected and varied from the original written curriculum materials. In addition, teachers provided with curriculum materials that contained educative features foregrounding scientific content tended to use scientific language to describe the 3 phenomena more frequently and more accurately than teachers given curriculum materials without the educative features. Teacher interviews provided insight into teachers' perceived struggles enacting the whole-class discussion and teachers' perceived importance of the use of scientific language. These findings have implications for curriculum developers, teacher educators, and teachers. The study highlights the need to support teachers' use of scientific language and ability to talk science with elementary students.\", \"A minimal problem is formulated for determining the microstructure of open celled, low density materials.

To this end, a real manufacture chain was stopped in the course of the process, and samples of all intermediate stages were extracted. Thus the drawing intensity or straining level (represented by the yield strength) is treated as the fundamental variable to elucidate the consequences of the manufacturing route on the posterior fracture performance of the material. A materials science approach to the phenomenon is proposed, so that the strongly anisotropic fracture behaviour of the steels with high level of strain hardening (which exhibit a 90degrees step in the fracture surface) is rationalized on the basis of the markedly oriented pearlitic microstructure of the drawn steels which influences the operative micromechanism of fracture in this case.

For the purpose of the review monoliths formed from these various alternative materials will be termed 'Exotic Monoliths', as these new substrates in many cases have only just begun to be explored for chromatographic separations, and in many instances have unusual and highly selective surface chemistries, which are attractive in terms of broadening the choice of monolithic materials for separation science. An extensive range of monolithic materials based on the following elements and their compounds (mostly oxides) are covered: Zr, Ti, Al, Hf, C, Au, Ag, Ce, Ge and hydroxyapatite, together with their relevant properties, methods of synthesis, and current and potential applications in separation science.

In many cases, it has been demonstrated that conformational change and aggregation can occur outside living cells and complex biochemical networks. Hence, approaches from materials and physical science have enhanced our understanding of the role of protein aggregation in these diseases at the molecular and nanoscale levels. In this article, we will review what is known about these protein structures from the perspective of materials science, focusing on the details of emergent oligomeric and nanotube-like structures, their interactions with model lipid bilayers, how the structures relate to observed biological phenomena, and how protein aggregation and amyloid formation can be employed for the good in biology and materials science.\", \"The investigation of nanocrystalline materials is one of the very active areas in the material science and engineering.

The essence of the activation technology for materials lies in an intensive increase of physical and chemical activity of their components in the interphase boundaries that is realized in various technological conversions. It has been established that being chemically passive under normal conditions all the materials, irrespective of their nature and aggregate state, can be chemically active under specific conditions. Such approach makes it possible to use low-active cheap silica raw material and technogenic production wastes for creation of strong composite materials on their basis.\\nDevelopment of the activation technologies for solid- and liquid -phase components of road construction composite materials is gradually transformed in a special branch of material science that is coprology. The branch is presupposed to develop a theory and solve applied problems directed on efficient usage of technogenic production wastes as cheap raw material source for obtaining a wide range of construction materials for general and special application. Further investigation is to execute a technical modernization and develop technological equipment for activation of solid, liquid and gaseous components of road construction composite materials.

Earth system science Views the Earth as a synergistic physical system of interrelated phenomena, processes and cycles which remain largely unexplored in traditional disciplinary Earth science course offerings. The ongoing Cooperative University-based Program for Earth System Science Education (ESSE) challenges colleges and universities to develop and offer classroom courses which examine the Earth as a system and to share their progress, course materials and learning modules. Concurrent with the development of the ESSE community and its shared learning resources has been the exponential growth of the Internet and its suite of communication tools, which are a central resource for the ESSE Program. The Internet has enabled the rapid deployment of information and resources through shared repositories of learning materials and general Earth system science knowledge, all of which serve to create and maintain an active informed education community. ESSE participants are organizing to develop a suite of web-based Earth system science learning modules and sharing course materials and learning resources via the ESSE web site. The modular approach more easily assimilates peer-reviewed learning resources into a wide range of classroom environments. A web-based peer-reviewed Journal of Earth System Science Education is proposed to provide educators with quality classroom materials addressing the Earth as a system and to reward ESS resource developers with citable references. More sophisticated web search and retrieval functions, as well as advanced communication tools will be needed to maintain automated databases of networked resources and an informed user community as Earth system science and the Internet enter the new millennium.

Most policies state the acceptance of supplementary materials, and even journals without a policy also publish supplementary materials. The majority of supplementary materials provided in LIS articles are extended methodological explanations and additional results in the form of textual information in PDF or Word files. Some toll-access journals provide open access to any reader to these files.\\nOriginality/value - This study provides new insights into the characteristics of supplementary materials in US journals. The results may be used by journal publishers to establish a policy on the publication of supplementary materials and, more broadly, to develop data sharing initiatives in academic settings.\", \"Avoiding the catastrophic failure of a large structure demands the material's microstructure be designed in such as a way as to render any crack present innocuous thereby raising the integrity of that structure. Structural integrity of a composite material embraces contributions from: materials science and engineering; processing science; design and fabrication technology. It combines a number of interacting factors: the criticality of the application; the accessibility for and ability to inspect vital parts and components; the intended use including load spectrum and time; the consequences of impact, fatigue, temperature and hostile environment; the nature of inherent flaws; the constituent properties of the material system utilized; and it takes into account human factors.\", \"Metal micro-/nano-particles with suitable chemical modification can be organized into new ceramic-metal (cermet) or organic-metal (orgmet) composites or structured materials.

Many boundaries among science, engineering and social systems are cross-linked in the face of combinations of knowledge and tools. It is the time we look at how things work at a system level from past, present to future with great precision. It is the time when the physical, biological and social sciences are joining forces with information sciences and technology. It is the time when we will make extraordinary advances in the history of mankind through information sciences and technologies.\\nRecently the system view of technologies is emerging. In this paper, we classify technology and information sciences into three main domains: (1) physical technology and information science (non-organic/nonliving material-based); (2) biological technology and information science (organic/living material-based); and (3) societal technology and information science (language/mind-based). Furthermore we exam each branch of technologies and information sciences and establish a system-based model of technology and information sciences and discuss the evolution and future trends of technology and information sciences.\", \"Science and Technology (S&T), like Research and Development (R&D), has become a case of capital investment like any other economic sector. This has distanced R&D from social needs, to the extent that part of R&D ends up actually being fictitious, in the sense that it acquires a price on the market but never becomes part of material production processes. The concept referred to here as fictitious science is parallel to the fictitious capital used to account for financial assets that have no material counterpart. R&D and S&T have gone from being a service to the community to being sectors for capital investment, driven to producing profits by cost-benefit criteria. At the same time that scientific production is being productively exploited, a form of science has evolved that is not evaluated for its content but for its price. This is fictitious science that is not used for production and ends up being superfluous and with no relationship at all with social needs. However, the paradox is that although their products have a price, they end up in many cases not being used as part of material production processes.\", \"This study was based on the hypothesis that advances in cognitive science may be helpful for Coach Development Programs. We wondered: How can a learning tool such as a digital workbook that is informed by evidence-based pedagogical principles be helpful for coach development? After designing the learning material, based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, the digital workbook was used in a coach development program that aimed to improve coaches' need-supportiveness. Ten coaches at an elite sport school in Norway attended the program over a season, and afterwards they were asked whether the learning material had contributed to their knowledge of need-supportive skills. Thematic analysis of the interviews revealed visualization, awareness, and transfer to one's practice as the three main themes describing the educational value of the digital workbook. The material showed the coaches how need-support can be acted out in a sport-specific context. Additionally, the learning material resulted in increased engagement and awareness through coaches' reflections, which is an important step towards integrating new material to prior knowledge and create meaningful learning. Finally, the coaches highlighted transfer of the presented learning material to their practice experiences. We conclude that cognitive science may have useful implications for the design of effective learning materials for coach development programs.\", \"In the quest for new semiconductor materials and processes, researchers focus on self-assembly, a concept that draws from diverse disciplines like chemistry, biology, material science, and electrical engineering.\", \"Swift heavy ions (SHI) ions with energy which produce large electronic energy loss are now being used for modification of the properties of the materials through electron phonon coupling. Characteristic defects produced by heavy ions in insulators can also be produced in other materials if sufficient energy can be locked into electronic energy which can be transferred to the lattice. Electronic energy loss in the materials can be varied in the range of eV/A to 10 keV/A by choosing appropriate ions and their energies. This flexibility coupled with new possibilities with cluster beams are providing opportunities to engineer the properties of all kinds of materials for the future. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, its inclusion in science teaching may not have the desired effect due to the limited coverage it receives in textbooks and the limited time available for teaching. A historical episodes map (HEM) is thus developed with four storylines and more than 20 events related to the history of science and is designed to fit in with regular teaching topics. A total of 329 students in Grade 7 were involved in the experimental group and the control group. The control group was taught using the textbook only, while the experimental group was also taught using the textbook plus HEM materials and associated discussion. The intervention of such teaching lasted for a month and a half. The findings reveal that the exposure of students to HEM materials did promote the students' understanding of the nature of science as well as their attitudes toward science.\", \"The University of California has recently funded a new Lead Campus program: Research and Education in Green Materials, a multi-campus graduate fellowship program designed to bridge the disciplinary boundaries of engineering, science, toxicology and social science.

A new subject of EEFMS involved in many subject knowledge, such as materials, energy and environment, has come into being due to the rapid development of the advance industry of energy and environment materials in the last decade, as well as a serial of new industries of micro-environment control functional materials, and so on. At the same time, the university education was accelerated in the direction of the research in EEFMS.\\nOne of the remarkable developments in materials science was the new advance industry technology in energy and environment materials in the twentieth century. Subsequently the innovative talents in the fields were demanded urgently by the government. For the reason, the research and university education in energy and environment materials began as early as ten years ago. The subject of ecological environment functional materials (EEFMS) is the certain combination of materials science and engineering and environment science and engineering, which mainly concerns on the research and development of environment pollution and control functional materials and micro-environment control functional materialsr1-21. With the development in cyclic economy and energy-saving and emission reduction technology, the exiting single speciality education, such as materials, environment, energy, physics, chemistry, engineer, et al, can not satisfy the urgent demand for compound technological talents.

Considerable time is spent covering materials already covered in other courses such as General Physics and Introduction to Engineering. Moreover, most GChem courses are oriented toward health science majors and lack a materials focus relevant to engineering. Taking an atoms first approach, we developed and now run a one-semester course in general chemistry for engineers emphasizing relevant materials topics. Laboratory exercises integrate practical examples of materials science enriching the course for engineering students. First-semester calculus and a calculus-based introduction to engineering course are prerequisites, which enables teaching almost all the topics from a traditional two semester GChem course in this new course with advance topics as well. To support this course, an open access textbook in LibreText, formerly ChemWiki was developed entitled General Chemistry for Engineering. Many of the topics were supported using Chemical Excelets and Materials Science Excelets, which are interactive Excel/Calc spreadsheets.

However, not every question translates into a \\\"good\\\" science investigation. Questions that drive science investigations can be provided by many sources including the teacher, the curriculum, or the student. The variations in the source of investigation questions were explored in this study. A dataset of 120 elementary science classroom videos and associated lesson plans from 40 elementary teachers (K-5) across 21 elementary school campuses were scored on an instrument measuring the amount of teacher-direction or student-direction of the lessons' investigation questions. Results indicated that the investigation questions were overwhelmingly teacher directed in nature, with no opportunities for students to develop their own questions for investigation. This study has implications for researchers and practitioners alike, calling attention to the teacher-directed nature of investigation questions in existing science curriculum materials, and the need for teacher training in instructional strategies to adapt their existing curriculum materials across the continuum of teacher-directed and student-directed investigation questions. Teachers need strategies for adapting the teacher-directed questions provided in their existing curriculum materials in order to allow students the opportunity to engage in this essential scientific practice.\", \"The interpretation of relaxation spectra of second-order cross-effects is a problem that arises in some branches of materials science when coupling between thermal, mechanical and dielectric quantities is investigated.

The materials being developed and tested, called Classroom FeederWatch (CFW), aimed to support science inquiry and were developed by a collaborative team of private curriculum developers and scientists (ornithologists). Inquiry dimensions were influenced at the outset by the newly released National Science Education Standards (National Research Council, Washington, DC: National Academy Press, 1996) and by prior successful experiences of ornithologists with inquiry experiences for adults. Despite hopes that CFW materials would assist middle school students to learn inquiry, evaluation findings showed little increase in students' understanding of inquiry or the ability to plan and conduct inquiry. We learned that improvements to inquiry dimensions of the curriculum required aligning activities more closely with practices that reflected the work of scientists in the discipline, integrating learning of content knowledge with learning about inquiry, and adjusting evaluation protocols to more accurately assess inquiry as represented in the Standards.

However with the increase of complexity of materials, the scientific ability for the rational materials design becomes progressively limited. As a result of this complexity combinatorial and high-throughput (CHT) experimentation in materials science has been recognized as a new scientific approach to generate new knowledge. This review demonstrates the broad applicability of CHT experimentation technologies in discovery and optimization of new materials. We discuss general principles of CHT materials screening followed by the detailed discussion of high-throughput materials characterization approaches, advances in data, analysis/mining, and new materials developments facilitated by CHT experimentation. We critically analyze results of materials development in the areas most impacted by the CHT approaches, such as catalysis, electronic and functional materials, polymer-based industrial coatings, sensing materials, and biomaterials.\", \"The prospects for the development of the materials science of oxide semiconductors maintaining a spin orientation of the charge carriers above room temperatures are considered.

Educational materials suitable for a range of ages are included, from coloring exercises for younger students through to explanations of cutting-edge science in straightforward language for older students. This article contains a handout with influenza facts, a coloring page, a glossary and word find and a connect-the-dots exercise explaining the ideas behind recently published scientific papers.

The fact is that welds and advanced materials with interfaces and steep gradients require more comprehensive analytical treatments. Future chemical, physical, and mechanical analysis and implementations need further refinement, such as incorporation of the non-linear behavior associated with interfaces and gradients. The application of wave mechanics with wave-perturbing nondestructive tools and practices to assess more than one property measurement should enable a comprehensive understanding of the material state. The use of electronic, magnetic, and elastic assessments to evaluate the material state will be an everyday practice, including the establishment of electronic metallography practices.\", \"The study deals with material support for practical work in science classes in Slovenian primary schools (grades 1-5). It answers the question of why there are differences in national tests in terms of socioeconomic development of the environment, despite the fact that schools are equally well equipped. There are two groups of teachers: in less-developed regions (N= 337) and in more-developed regions (N= 160) - the criterion is the \\\"the development risk index.\\\" Material research equipment in Slovenian schools is poor. Socioeconomic development does not affect the perception of problems such as: the lack of materials and equipment, oversized groups, poor spatial conditions, and the absence of an assistant. Equipment is provided by schools, while material is brought by the pupils themselves. Comparison has shown that students in more developed environments bring their own material more frequently, which enables more research activities. It was concluded that despite the fact that the material conditions in all Slovenian schools are similar, there are differences in the development level of inquiry skills. In more-developed regions, students compensate the lack of material by providing aids from their home environment.\", \"In recent years, China is vigorously promoting the public entrepreneurship and innovation, making in-depth implementation of college students' innovation and entrepreneurship leading plan, thus innovation and entrepreneurship education system has become the current hot spot of the student work in colleges and universities. In this paper, taking material science as an example, we have proposed to build the innovation and entrepreneurship education system at the grassroots level based on the subject background, and made an organic combination of the innovation and entrepreneurship education, material subject background and professional knowledge education. On the one hand, the course system of innovation and entrepreneurship in material science should be established. Besides, innovation and entrepreneurship courses and related cross-disciplinary courses should be added. We can also form a part-time supervisor team of innovation and entrepreneurship and make a school-enterprise joint teaching model to guide students to do the entrepreneurship steadily. On the other hand, we should carry out innovation and entrepreneurship extracurricular credit system management, and organize innovation and entrepreneurship activities with professional characteristics, to develop the students' innovative thinking and entrepreneurial ability. The potential points of innovation and entrepreneurship in subjects and professions should be excavated. We are also supposed to lay stress on practice and try to innovate. The two-pronged approach must be done to build an innovation and entrepreneurship education model based on the background of material science.\", \"This review paper presents briefly the main concepts of nonlinear dynamics and their exemplary manifestations in selected systems, including those important from the point of view of materials science. It is an extended version of the conference presentation. The conditions of instabilities leading to spontaneous formation of dissipative structures are given. Principles of nonlinear dynamics are illustrated with several examples from the homogeneous and heterogeneous and physical and chemical systems: pattern formation in the convective motion of fluids subject to various kinds of driving forces, periodic precipitation phenomena, oscillations, and pattern formation in the Belousov-Zhabotinski (BZ) reaction and the catalytic oxidation of thiocyanate ions with hydrogen peroxide, as well as bistability and tristability in the electrochemical reduction of azide complexes of nickel(II). The application of nonlinear dynamics in materials science is first exemplified by its role in polymerization reactions. Such processes can either exhibit internal couplings leading to oscillations or can be coupled with the chemical oscillatory process through, e.g., the covalent bonding of its catalyst to the polymer network. Other selected examples of the application of nonlinear dynamics in materials science, referring to electrochemical processes, were briefly reviewed. Nonlinear dynamics appears to be useful for designing new materials, including those at the nanoscale.\", \"The Paper reviews the current status of Nondestructive Testing and Evaluation (NDT&E), in relation to materials science and technology.

This framework serves as the basis for developing learning materials and teachers' professional development programs, taking into account the project's objectives, target audiences as well as RRI aspects. The development of learning materials is based on a combining well defined of scientific big ideas, RRI big ideas, Nature of Science ideas and scientific practices.\\nPiloting of the learning materials took place in 4 European countries: Norway, Israel, Cyprus and UK.\\nOur assessment tools include: classroom observations, evaluation questionnaires, interviews with teachers and students, as well as website analytics (number of users, page views, material downloads, branding resources downloads, social media hits).

Similarly in Japan, in order to promote the originality, intellectual curiosity, research interest in science, technology, mathematics of students, and to foster the next generation of leaders in science and technology, many programs such as SSH(Super Science High Schools), SPP(Science Partnership Project), and so on have been performed. However, over the years, it has been a problem in Japan that students do not actually feel the significance and usefulness of studying science. It's said that substantiality of empirical learning is important in order to let a student recognize the significance of studying science. In order to improve a student's individual skill and volition, teachers have to understand the personality of each student further, and find the time for students to face the teachers while cooperating with an organization outside of the school. However, the school hours for experimental trainings in science and technology will not be increased when it was reviewed from its circumstances of the past courses of study. Furthermore, it is difficult to conduct time-consuming experiments and training in a public junior high school due to extra costs, extra works required more than a regular lesson and teaching. Even though, most teachers have high volition and consciousness about the education in the school. Therefore, effective educational materials are required in science and technology. Junior high school students are fascinated with new technology. A robot is considered to be a motivation to increase a student's interest in science or technology. The aim of this study is to validate the effectiveness and problems of the utilization of a robot as an education material for usual classes in a public junior high school.\\nA collaboration science and technology class was performed in third grade of Kazokita Junior High School in Saitama, Japan, using small mobile robots as teaching materials. The number of students was 39. Ten teaching assistants volunteered. The class lesson was carried out for two hours continuously with a break of 10 minutes in between. A small mobile robot was assembled using electric parts on a bead board as an educational material in the class. The application program used to mobilize the mobile robot was S4A(Scratch for Arduino) and modified specifically for the class. The contents taught are related to the science and technology text book chapter \\\"Information and communications technology in our life\\\" and \\\"Let's know a role and the function of the program\\\". The questionnaire surveys of the science class showed that students recognized that they made a robot by themselves and most students enjoyed the class and want to do again. As a result, the utilization of the small mobile robot as an educational material with the cooperation between a junior high school and a university was very effective not only in order to achieve the purpose of a science lesson, but also in order to evoke the interest of engineering and science.\", \"The characteristics and the synthesis principle of nanocrystalline materials prepared by electrodeposition are summaried in this paper.

In this talk, we discuss the role of computation and simulation in the dramatic advances of the past and those we are witnessing today. We will also describe the growing acceptance and impact of computational materials science as a major component of materials research and its import for the future. In the process, we will demonstrate how the well-recognized goal driving computational physics/computational materials science-simulations of ever-increasing complexity on more and more realistic models-has been brought into greater focus with the introduction of greater computing power that is readily available to run sophisticated and powerful software codes like our highly precise full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FLAPW) method, now also running on massively parallel computer platforms.\\nWe will then describe some specific advances we are witnessing today, and computation and simulation as a major component of quantum materials design and its import for the future, with the goal-to synthesize materials with desired properties in a controlled way via materials engineering on the atomic scale.

In order to do this, the theoretical path is presented that the author and his colleagues followed, with the aim of using some concepts and theoretical and methodological approaches taken from social sciences for a better consideration of society and materials issues. The gender/materials connection does not appear to have been dealt with yet in a systematic way, although there are some interesting studies and insights. This connection instead appears very important in the light of a sociological reflection focusing on the relations among the social actors involved in the cycle of materials. The centrality of social actors within the processes that define the value chain and life cycle of products and materials is presented and, in this framework, the importance of design is stressed, together with other typical phenomena highlighted within social sciences such as closure or negotiation, power relations, etc. Particularly, considerations on gender appear important because they imply the possibility to include the different points of view, approaches and solutions of gender-diverse actors. Gender differences and gender related dynamics emerges as relevant in the definition of research priorities, in the analysis of needs, uses, and social and environmental impacts of materials and products is likely to limit the potential and distort the perspective of materials science. In this framework, existing data are presented that show that materials represent an area of scientific research (both academic and non-academic) where the under-representation of women is presently recorded and probably impacts on the materials sector as a whole. The proposed reflection on the relation between gender and materials is still a very initial one, but further research is advisable in light of the centrality of sustainable policy issues such as the Circular Economy (CE) where it is important to focus the attention on the role of social actors in the entire product cycle and not only in its final part (e.g., the purchase of consumer goods, their use, disposal, re-use, etc.). A further reflection on gender and materials could also be relevant for LCA.\", \"Provision of a concise summary of recent developments of permanent magnet materials and the materials science underlining them toward realizing permanent magnets beyond the current Nd-Dy-Fe-B is attempted, and approaches to solving the remaining fundamental issues are discussed. Focused are two promising groups of materials: the ThMn12-type Fe-rich Sm(Fe1-xCox)(12-) based materials and the Nd2Fe14B-based materials. Materials science based on atomistic view of permanent magnet materials specifically developed for this purpose is required in order to break into a precise control of the microstructure in atomic levels with the aid of computational material engineering. Atomistic understandings of coercivity mechanism and differences in free energy associated with formation of non-equilibrium structures such as grain boundaries and interfaces with sub-phases are proposed to be essential.\", \"This article aims to explain why classical thermodynamics is insufficient in macroscopic modeling of solids.

The analyses show that the teacher was progressively able to promote argumentation, both in whole-class and group work interactions, from lesson 1: argumentative interactions were increasingly responsive and engaging, and the teacher's group supervision was progressively argumentatively oriented.

There was no significant difference in learning outcome between those taking the module on campus and by distance learning. This suggests that the prerequisites for entry, learning materials and direction given to the students studying by distance learning are adequate for these students to achieve the learning objectives outlined in the course.

From complex devices such as hydrogen cars to simpler gadgets like lighters, almost everything is related with chemistry. Motivation of students in both materials science and chemistry is important, so they can understand the necessity of these areas in our society. In this regard, the synthesis of materials, which can be obtained in a simple way, offers a possibility to encourage students to learn these sciences.\\nPiezoelectric compounds can be defined as materials that produce some electric charge when a mechanical stress is applied. These materials are used in several devices such as lighters, speakers, sensors or sonars. Specifically, compounds based on Pb(Zr,Ti)O-3 (PZT) are the most extended piezoelectric materials found in lighters. The good correlation between structure-composition-properties of this material and its easy preparation makes it suitable to use in low value-added devices.\\nIn this work, we propose an example to demonstrate students the importance and complexity of the materials chemistry. First, a commercial piezoelectric material present in a lighter was analyzed. Then, piezoelectric materials based on PZT were obtained by the classical ceramic method. All materials were studied by different characterization techniques applied in solid-state chemistry, such as X-ray Diffraction and Scanning Electronic Microscopy. Finally, electric properties of the synthesized materials were studied and they were tested in a real lighter.

Sustainability can also be represented by a stool whose legs are economic, social and environmental issues. This presentation will examine materials that have changed because of the requirements that have been imposed by the sustainable building community. While some of these materials perform functions that lower the environmental impacts of buildings, many are not inherently sustainable themselves because the holistic impacts of the raw materials and processes used in their manufacture were not addressed. It is necessary to simultaneously address the three legs of the sustainability stool and the three legs of the materials stool in order to create materials that are truly sustainable.\", \"The processes of curricula, textbooks and student resources development have been broadly surveyed and studied while teachers' guides have received comparatively little consideration throughout recent reforms in science education. Ideal curriculum materials align instruction with the goals of reform. Well-designed teachers' guides contribute to communicating and supporting reform-based teaching. The purpose of this study was to investigate the functions and assistance that guides provide science teachers. A questionnaire was developed and administered to science teachers from a stratified sample of elementary and junior high schools in Taiwan. The findings indicated that the guides were of greater benefit to elementary school science teachers than they were to junior high teachers. These groups of teachers perceived the guides' usefulness differently, but they believed that a clear, concise presentation of the purpose, reminders, answer keys, concept maps of the main topics and learning progression provided the most helpful and preferred layout. Teachers felt that the function of a teachers' guide is to provide teaching resources rather than to guide teacher thinking. This study discusses design suggestions that can engage teacher thinking.\", \"The availability of high performance computers and development of efficient algorithms has led to the emergence of computational materials science as the third branch of materials research complementing the traditional theoretical and experimental approaches. It has created new virtual realities in materials design that are either experimentally not realizable easily or are prohibitively expensive.

This study examined 57 randomly selected elementary bilingual/bicultural science classrooms in a large metropolitan area of the southwestern United States in terms of culturally syntonic variables (i.e., culture-of-origin beliefs and/or practices that impact the teaching/learning process). Findings from this study indicate that Hispanic/Latino children are receiving science instruction: (a) with culturally asyntonic printed materials, teaching strategies, and supplementary materials, (b) in classrooms that do not use the child's native language, familia learning groups, peer tutoring, or manipulative materials, and (c) with oral and verbal instruction that lack culturally syntonic role models, examples, analogies, and elaborations. Findings from this study imply that changes are needed in preservice and in-service teacher training, in science textbook formats, and in the scope and focus of elementary school bilingual/bicultural science curriculum and instructional strategies.\", \"This study uses a sample of Japanese university scientists in life and materials sciences to examine how academic entrepreneurship has affected the norms and behaviors of academic scientists regarding sharing scientific resources. Results indicate that high levels of academic entrepreneurship in a scientific field are associated with less reliance on the gift-giving form of sharing (i.e., generalized exchange) traditionally recommended by scientific communities, and with a greater emphasis on direct benefits for givers (i.e., direct exchange), as well as a lower overall frequency of sharing. We observe these shifts in sharing behavior even among individual scientists who are not themselves entrepreneurially active; this suggests a general shift in scientific norms contingent on institutional contexts. These findings reflect contradictions inherent in current science policies that simultaneously encourage open science as well as commercial application of research results, and they suggest that the increasing emphasis on commercial activity may fundamentally change the normative structure of science.\", \"In this report, we first demonstrate that chemistry is the central science from the science of matter to the science of life; i.e., chemistry is essential for food supply and resources, for understanding life processes, for providing clean and renewable energy, for material science, for information technology, and for environmental sciences. Then, we summarize the recent advances in chemical sciences in China, in nano science and technology, material chemistry, supramolecular self-assembly, organic synthesis, and more fundamentally physical and theoretical chemistry. Chinese chemists have not only made significant progress in chemical research but also assumed international responsibility in tackling globally challenging problems by collaborating with international chemists and providing chemical solutions to energy, environment, health, and resources problems.

The large audience included the Chief Executive of DERA, the Vice Chancellor of the University, and a number of distinguished visitors many of whom had played key roles in the establishment and development of composite materials. The topic, fibre composites, was very appropriate for the occasion. Moreover, the privilege of having as the inaugural lecturer Tony Kelly, one of the fathers of the science of composite materials, was especially apt. Much of his pioneering research into the mechanical properties of composites was carried out at Cambridge in the 1960s; Tony also knew Jim Gordon, and their different yet complementary contributions established Britain as a leading player in the development of composites as advanced structural materials. Tony Kelly's lecture was the first of an annual series which will feature aspects of the science and technology of composites, and will be promoted in association with the DERA-Cambridge Gordon Laboratory. The series is already being referred to as the Kelly lectures.\", \"This research reports on a study of curriculum materials development and use compared with the use of existing curriculum materials in an elementary classroom. The research explored the effect of explicit attention to epistemic practices in curriculum materials and the enactment of those materials. Epistemic practices include asking questions, collecting data, making descriptions of observations, finding patterns in the data, and developing scientific reasoning. Scaffolding considered the function, role, and purpose of epistemic practices in the community of science and the production of scientific knowledge. The designed curriculum was compared with an existing pedagogically similar curriculum to consider whether the scaffolding and explicitness affected enactment. Findings lead to the conclusion that enactment was impacted. Specifically, findings show that scaffolding in materials created more instances of students engaging in scientific reasoning. Similarly, the explicit description of epistemic practices supported the teacher in explicitly providing opportunities for children to learn about and use epistemic practices of science. Finally, when using the designed curriculum, teacher modifications during enactment showed to be more consistent with the intended instructional approach and also helpful for children in learning epistemic practices of science.\", \"This study offers new insights into the ongoing debate about whether physical and virtual materials are equally effective in inquiry-based science instruction. Physical materials were predicted to have a surplus value when haptic feedback helps discern object characteristics or when the perceived credibility of experimental data can impede conceptual change. Both assumptions were tested by comparing the belief revisions and confidence ratings of children (n = 60) engaged in an inquiry task about falling objects. Children were assigned to one of three instructional conditions that differed with regard to the type of materials and the possibility to manipulate those materials. Main findings confirmed the alleged benefits of physical manipulation in correcting misconceptions about object characteristics that are perceived by touch. Belief revision about visually discernible characteristics proved independent of the type of material and type of manipulation, as was children's confidence in their post-instructional beliefs. Together, these findings indicate that tactile cues derived from physical manipulation can have a unique contribution to children's science learning.\", \"The examination of natural materials at the microscopic and microchemical level from a materials science perspective can occasionally suggest advances in modern materials engineering.

This paper contends that this organizational model can be traced to the \\\"Interdisciplinary Laboratories\\\" program funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency in 1960. The novelty of the IDL program was that it created a peer group of university laboratories with sustained funding to ensure their institutional stability. The Cornell Materials Science Center, one of the first three Interdisciplinary Laboratories, served as a breeding ground for a new community of engineering faculty members, who subsequently helped establish a series of interdisciplinary research centers at Cornell, including the National Research and Resource Facility for Submicron Structures (or National Submicron Facility) in 1977. The Materials Science Center and National Submicron Facility provided explicit models for the expansion and coordination of networks of interdisciplinary centers, both within single universities (such as Cornell) and across multiple campuses (through programs such as the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network and the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers). The center model has proved both flexible and durable in the face of changing demands on universities.

Teachers taught units on photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and matter cycling in ecosystems in their regular classes under conditions varying as to whether or not conceptual change-oriented instructional materials and training sessions were provided. Greater use of conceptual change teaching strategies was associated with use of the special instructional materials, but not with the training. Students in classes where teachers were provided with the materials tended to perform better on posttests than those where such materials were not provided. The use of the conceptual change strategies by teachers was also associated with higher student performance on tests designed to assess conceptual change learning.

Pickering's approach is situated within a performative idiom of science and seeks to account for the interplay of material and human agency in scientific practice. It sees scientific and technological advances as emerging temporally from a dialectic of resistance and accommodation, metaphorically the mangle of practice. This paper introduces the main tenets of Pickering's argument, contextualizing it within the field of science and technology studies. It then explores some of the implications of construing translation in these terms. Firstly, this conceptual approach helps to recognize the role of translation in the performance of science and to seek ways of studying translation practices as an integral component of scientific practices. Secondly, Pickering's posthumanist or decentred perspective focuses on both material and human agency and the interplay between them; a similar approach to the study of translation would foreground the interaction between translator agency and material performativity in studies of translation practices. I conclude with proposals for adopting this ontological shift in translation studies, where it may have the potential to enhance our understanding of translation practices, in particular in relation to tools, technologies and sociotechnical developments in translation.\", \"Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are promising photovoltaic (PV) materials owing to their advantages such as high carrier mobility, excellent absorption coefficient, bandgap tenability, long diffusion length, and low material cost.

The paradigm started in the pharmaceutical industry but was rapidly adopted to accelerate materials research in a wide variety of areas. High throughput experiments are characterized by synthesis of a \\\"library\\\" sample that contains the materials variation of interest (typically composition), and rapid and localized measurement schemes that result in massive data sets. Because the data are collected at the same time on the same \\\"library\\\" sample, they can be highly uniform with respect to fixed processing parameters. This article critically reviews the literature pertaining to applications of combinatorial materials science for electronic, magnetic, optical, and energy-related materials. It is expected that high throughput methodologies will facilitate commercialization of novel materials for these critically important applications. Despite the overwhelming evidence presented in this paper that high throughput studies can effectively inform commercial practice, in our perception, it remains an underutilized research and development tool. Part of this perception may be due to the inaccessibility of proprietary industrial research and development practices, but clearly the initial cost and availability of high throughput laboratory equipment plays a role. Combinatorial materials science has traditionally been focused on materials discovery, screening, and optimization to combat the extremely high cost and long development times for new materials and their introduction into commerce. Going forward, combinatorial materials science will also be driven by other needs such as materials substitution and experimental verification of materials properties predicted by modeling and simulation, which have recently received much attention with the advent of the Materials Genome Initiative. Thus, the challenge for combinatorial methodology will be the effective coupling of synthesis, characterization and theory, and the ability to rapidly manage large amounts of data in a variety of formats.

It is becoming clear that polymer science and technology will play a pivotal role in the emerging 'chemistry direct to shapes' era where molecular level design, synthesis and assembly of the spatially resolved 'active' materials systems of the future will bypass many of the issues of incommensurate engineering associated with bolt-on actuators, sensors, etc., currently envisaged. The issues of massively parallel information processing to provide a knowledge response mode will also hinge on developments in polymer science and the molecular level control of interface structures. The core competencies required are already becoming apparent and are briefly reviewed in this paper.\"]"
