"[\"In this review an improvement of photostability in formulation is discussed the issue of photostability in pharmaceutical dosage forms. This review deals with mechanism of photo-degradation with examples, factors affecting photostability, formulation characteristics affecting photostability, ICH guidelines for testing photostability of new drug substances and products. Various reported formulation approaches which improved photostability have also been discussed.\", \"The photostability of five benzanthrone dye derivatives containing unsaturated allylic group(s) was investigated and the structure-photostability relationship was found. Their copolymers with methylmethacrylate had an intense colour, and were stable to solvents and fluorescence, due to the chemical bonding of the dye in the polymer chain. Photostability of the dyes thus included in the polymer molecule increased and their influence on the photostability of the polymers was determined. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.

The photostability of monoazo disperse dyes in solvents with different polarities was evaluated thereafter the dyes in each solvent were irradiated with visible light for 8 hours. The percentage of photostability of the dye decreased from the initial value in the range of 5-10%. The photostability was affected by the substituted group of the dyes regardless of the solvent used. Different R-1 group on the diazo component increased the photostability in order of H>CN>Cl. The photostability of the dye was also higher when R-2 group on the coupling component was a methyl group.\", \"The relationship between photostability and dispersed structures of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):fullerene films was studied using atomic force microscopy and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. The films with higher dispersity showed better photostability. An evaluation method based on UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy was found to be promising to estimate the photostability of the films.\", \"We have studied the feasibility of using luminophores in the coumarin series in luminescent filters for correcting the spectra of light-emitting diode (LED) light sources. Fine tuning of the emission spectra of luminophores in polymer matrices is achieved by introducing nonionic surfactants into the matrix. We propose a method for estimating the photostability of luminescent filters and we determine the photostability parameters.\", \"The photostability of three polymerizable 9-phenylxanthene dyer; was investigated. Their copolymers with methyl methacrylate (MMA) were obtained and it was found that dyes accelerated the rate of polymerization. The photostability of the dyes thus included in the polymer molecule increased and they also affected positively the photostability of the copolymers. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Based on dye chemical structures, their photobleaching and photostability indices are quite diverse. It is generally believed that among different fluorescent dyes, Alexa Fluor family has greater photostability than traditional dyes like fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and Cy5. Alexa Fluor 568 is a member of Alexa Fluor family presumed to have superior photostability and photobleahing profiles than FITC.\\nMaterials and Methods: In this experimental study, we conjugated Alexa Fluor 568 and FITC dyes to a mouse anti-human nestin monoclonal antibody (ANM) to acquire their photobleaching profiles and photostability indices. Then, the fluorophore/antibody ratios were calculated using a spectrophotometer. The photobleaching profiles and photostability indices of conjugated antibodies were subsequently studied by immunocytochemistry (ICC). Samples were continuously illuminated and digital images acquired under a fluorescent microscope. Data were processed by ImageJ software.\\nResults: Alexa Fluor 568 has a brighter fluorescence and higher photostability than FITC.\\nConclusion: Alexa Fluor 568 is a capable dye to use in photostaining techniques and it has a longer photostability when compared to FITC.\", \"This paper addresses two critical issues concerning the guidelines adopted by the ICH on the photostability testing: the quinine actinometry method and the light/radiation exposure map distribution of the photostability chamber. Using a qualified non-commercial photostability chamber tests were performed using quinine and physical actinometry and compared the results to those which are used as the basis of the ICH guidelines. The statistical analysis on the results showed that: (i) the calibration curve of the quinine solution depends on its concentration and on its location in the chamber; (ii) the quinine actinometry method currently recommended by the ICH guidelines should not be generalized to any photostability chamber.

A large improvement in photostability for pyrromethene was found in deoxygenated non-polar solvents, with a normalised photostability value of 1000 GJ/mol compared to deoxygenated polar solvents (100 GJ/mol). A high photostability has been observed in a heptane-1,4-dioxane azeotrope mixture and improvements observed in systems incorporating triplet quenching agents. Doped solid polymer samples showed an increased photostability up to 200 GJ/mol for the pyrromethene laser dye when samples were modified with triplet quenchers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The results revealed arbutin and deoxy arbutin to be photolabile in an aqueous solution. Deoxy arbutin was less stable than arbutin when exposed to UV radiation. The hydroquinone concentration was also increased during the radiation period in both solutions. Benzophenone-4 could clearly improve the photostability of arbutin during the period of UV radiation, but only slightly enhance the photostability of deoxy arbutin.\", \"The structure, fluorescence parameters, and photostability of nanocrystalline CdSe and CdSe/ZnS intended for biomedical applications are examined. The photostability of nanocrystalline CdSe/ZnS with different functional and protective coatings is studied. The possibility of using semiconductor nanoparticles as markers in various types of living cells is demonstrated.\", \"While previous work has demonstrated that molecular packing in organic crystals can strongly influence photochemical stability, efforts to tune photostability in amorphous materials have shown much smaller effects. Here we show that physical vapor deposition can substantially improve the photostability of organic glasses. Disperse Orange 37 (DO37), an azobenzene derivative, is studied as a model system. Photostability is assessed through changes in the density and molecular orientation of glassy thin films during light irradiation. By optimizing the substrate temperature used for deposition, we can increase photostability by a factor of 50 relative to the liquid-cooled glass. Photostability correlates with glass density, with density increases of up to 1.3%. Coarse-grained molecular simulations, which mimic glass preparation and the photoisomerization reaction, also indicate that glasses with higher density have substantially increased photostability. These results provide insights that may assist in the design of organic photovoltaics and light-emission devices with longer lifetimes.\", \"The effects of antioxidant addition and concentration on the photostability of methanol solutions of the pyrromethene laser dye 1,3,5,7,8 -pentamethyl-2,6-dimethylpyrromethene-difluoroborate complex (PM-567) were investigated. Specifically, methanol solutions of PM-567 were irradiated with 532 nm Nd:YAG laser pulses (2nd harmonic), and the photoluminescence measured as a function of accumulated laser pulses. The decrease in the photoluminescence-to-initial photoluminescence ratio with accumulated laser pulses was measured as a function of antioxidant addition and dye concentration. The addition of antioxidants, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2] octane (DABCO) and sodium azide (NaN3), resulted in a dramatic enhancement of photostability. whereas only nominal enhancement was observed upon n-propyl gallate addition. Over the concentration range 6 x 10(5) to 5 x 10(4) M, dye-photostability was virtually concentration independent, with only a small enhancement at lower concentrations. The normalized photostability, the half-life of accumulated energy per mole of dye, could not explain the concentration dependence of photostability. Reasons why the normalized photostability fails to explain the concentration trends are discussed. (C) 2001Elsevier Science Ltd.

Fluorescence analysis results showed that the photostability of two dyes could be greatly improved after being adsorbed on the surface of Mg-Al-CO3-LDH Matrix. Furthermore, photostability of adsorbed dyes was superior to that of intercalated dyes. It was suggested that AS or EO was adsorbed on LDHs surface through a strong chemisorption interaction, resulting in the enhancement of photostability. After the UV irradiation under N-2 atmosphere, the absorbed dyes not only show great increase of fluorescence intensity but also exhibited high stability against UV irradiation. This work provides a feasible approach to enhance the photostability of azoic dye confined in an inorganic two-dimensional (2D) matrix via changing the microenvironment, which may be considered to be a promising method of improving photostability of solid fluoresc ent materials.

The greatest photostability was found for a composite with a monocrystalline KH2PO4 matrix. This stability is related to the hindered diffusion of oxygen to the implanted CdTe/CdS quantum dots.\", \"We have investigated the photostability of an anti ferroelectric banana-shaped liquid crystal 4-chloro-1,3-phenylene bis [4-(4-n-tetradecyl) phenylimino methyl] benzoate by measuring its polarization as a function of photo-irradiation duration. Upon intense photo-irradiation for three hours, the banana-shaped liquid crystal exhibits a significant photostability although it bears the linkages of -COO- and -CH=N-.\", \"Pulsed laser deposition was used for the fabrication of amorphous thin films from Ge-As-Te system with the aim to study their intrinsic photostability. Photostability of prepared layers was studied using spectroscopic ellipsometry within as-deposited as well as relaxed layers. For irradiation, laser sources operating at three energies (1.17, 0.92 and 0.8 eV) in band gap region of the studied materials were employed. The lowest values of photorefraction (refractive index changes) accompanied with lowest changes of band gap values present Ge20As20Te60 thin films, which are therefore considered as the layers with highest photostability, especially in relaxed state.\", \"For apparel fibres, undyed colour and photostability are important properties, particularly for the production of brilliant white and bright pastel shade products that are essential for new and rapidly expanding casual markets such as trans-seasonal fashion knitwear, sports and leisurewear. Whilst wool has many excellent qualities that other fibres are still unable to emulate, its achievable whiteness and photostability when exposed to sunlight are both areas where wool compares poorly. Natural undyed wool is cream in colour, and commercial bleaching of wool is highly inefficient compared with cotton and synthetics. Oxidative bleaching of wool with hydrogen peroxide has a detrimental effect on photostability, as does the application of optical brighteners, which are seldom applied to wool for this reason.\\nWool colour-related research currently being undertaken within the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Sheep Industry Innovation aims to improve the whiteness and photostability of Merino wool by focussing on four key areas:-\\n1) Identification of the genetic and environmental factors which influence wool colour and photostability.\\n2) Determining whether variance exists in the photostability of wool and development of a rapid laboratory method for measuring photostability.\\n3) Analysis of the impact of downstream processing on whiteness and photostability and develop an optimised processing route for whites and pastel shades.\\n4) Determining the identity of the yellow chromophores responsible for the cream colour of natural wool.\\nThis paper outlines the aims of the CRC Wool Colour Research Program and the outcomes of the first twelve months of research in this challenging area.\", \"A feasible method of combining the concept of fluorescence half-life and the power dependent photobleaching rate for characterizing the practical photostability of fluorescent proteins (FPs) was introduced. Furthermore, by using a fluorescent photostability standard, a relative comparison of the photostabilty of FPs from different research groups was proposed, which would be of great benefit for developing novel FPs with optimized emission wavelength, better brightness, and improved photostability. We used rhodamine B as an example to verify this method and evaluate the practical photostability of a far-red FP, mKate-S158C. Experimental results indicated good potential of this method for further study.\", \"Context: Ophthalmic solutions are usually filled in a plastic bottle due to its durability and disposability. In Japan, photostability is one of the concerns for the quality control because an eye drop bottle must be a transparent container.\\nObjective: The present work studied the effect of textured eye drop bottles on its light blocking to improve the photostability of ophthalmic solutions.\\nMaterials and methods: We investigated the photostability of Pranoprofen ophthalmic solution filled in a variety of textured eye drop bottles. Pranoprofen content was analyzed by highperformance liquid chromatography and surface structure of textured eye drop bottles was evaluated by transmittance, calculated average roughness (Ra) and haze intensity.\\nResults: We observed that eye drop bottle which had greater than Ra value of 1.0 Jim and haze intensity 62% clearly showed photostability improvement.\\nConclusions: This report is the first one which shows that photostability of ophthalmic solution is improved by using textured eye drop bottle. Moreover, this approach is a simple and effective method to improve the photostability. This method is available for not only various ophthalmic applications but also other liquid pharmaceuticals or food products.\", \"The photostability of solid vesnarinone on exposure to daylight and lamplight was studied. The equivalent influences of light from different sources on the photostability of solid vesnarinone were observed. Results show that the relationship between the surface reflectance of solid vesnarinone and the cumulative illuminance of light from different sources can be accurately expressed by a curve fit, R = A + B(Et) + C/(Et + D); the daylight can be replaced by lamplight in photostability studies.\", \"To enhance the photostability of wood against ultraviolet (UV) light, a UV absorbent, 2,2',4'-trihydroxy-4-[2-hydroxy-3-(3-trimethoxysilylpropoxy) propoxy]benzophenone (BP), was applied to the reaction system for preparing SiO2 wood-inorganic composites by sol-gel reaction. The BP-SiO2 wood-inorganic composites obtained were examined for photostability by scanning electron microscope observations, color changes, and diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform analyses. The results clearly indicated that compared with SiO2 composites, BP-SiO2 composites improved the photostability of wood. In addition, BP was stable against UV light without degradation so that the BP-SiO2 composite should provide sustainable and high photostability of treated wood.\", \"The optical absorption, photostability and energy conversion efficiency of a series of heptamethine IR dyes are reported and results related to chemical structure. The high photostability and high laser energy conversion efficiency of several of the dyes indicate potential use in IR dye lasers.\", \"The photostability of fluorescent probes is critical in biological imaging, especially for long-term observational analyses. Here, we describe a simple and universal method to improve the photostability of semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) and other fluorescent probes by using buffers. Using Pdots as a model system, we found that HEPES or MES buffer can improve the photostability of Pdots by a factor of 20. Through a systematic study, we show that Pdot photobleaching is dominated by photoinduced radicals which can be quenched by the piperazine or morpholine structures of these buffers, which act as radical scavengers. For conditions where choice of buffer is limited, we designed fluorescent polymers conjugated with radical scavengers to improve Pdot photostability. We then demonstrate a practical application in which HEPES buffer is used to improve the photostability of Pdots during cell imaging.\", \"The concentration invariance of normalized photostability, the accumulated energy needed for a 50% reduction in dye concentration in units of GJ mole(-1), is investigated for 1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-2,6-di-t-butylpyrromethene-difluoroborate complex (PM-597) methanol solutions. Normalized photostability is purported to be concentration invariant. Result from this investigation, however, demonstrated increasing normalized photostabilities for decreasing concentrations, rendering normalized photostability inapplicable to PM-597 photodegradation. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.\", \"The photostability of J aggregates of the pseudoisocyanine dye in polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) polymer films under continuous irradiation with visible light was investigated. The decay of J aggregates in PVP is predominantly due to the reaction of photooxidation with singlet oxygen generated by triplet-state pseudoisocyanine dimers. Unlike the case of PVP, J aggregates in PVA demonstrate significantly higher photostability because of a lower PVP permeability for oxygen. A significant improvement in the photostability of J aggregates is achieved by the introduction of scavengers of singlet oxygen into the polymer films.\", \"The effect of polydopamine coating on improving photostability of polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) fiber was investigated in detail. Due to strong adhesion ability and self-polymerization of dopamine in alkaline solution, the polydopamine could be easily coated on polyphenylene sulfide fiber under mild conditions. XPS, ATR-FTIR and SEM, which indicated the polydopamine coating was homogeneous, confirmed the polydopamine coating on PPS fiber. The UV-spectra analysis of polydopamine coating showed that it had a strong absorbance in ultraviolet wavelength and was very stable to it, which implied that the polydopamine was a potential photoprotection agent. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) experiment further revealed that the PDA could quench free radicals, suggesting PDA was a good antioxidant. This scavenging ability of PDA might contribute to improving photostability of PPS fiber. Compared to pristine PPS fiber, the PPS fiber coated by polydopamine obviously had better photostability after ultraviolet irradiation according to mechanical test, which proved that polydopamine coating did improve the photostability of PPS fiber.\", \"Photobleaching of fluorophores is a big obstacle in their advanced application in various systems. Since many photobleaching pathways originate from the long-lifetime triplet (T-1) state, shortening the lifetime of the T-1 state is a rational strategy to enhance the photostability of the fluorophores. In this study, we observed that some lanthanide ions promoted the photostability of fluorophores by quenching the T-1 state via the triplet-triplet energy transfer from the fluorophore to the lanthanide ions.\", \"The nanoporous TiO2 film electrodes have been prepared by a sol-gel deposition process. The photostability of the electrodes in basic solutions has been studied. The results show that the photostability of the electrodes decreases rapidly in strong basic solutions with or without methanol. The reaction of holes to O-ad(2-) produces active O-ad(-) atoms and the products O-ad(-) atoms oxidize Ti3+ to Ti4+ on TiO2 film surface and subsurface. This results in the TiO2 film electrodes unstable in basic solutions both without methanol and with too low concentration.\", \"The photostability of polymerizable dyes, naphthalimide derivatives, two containing a stabilizer residue in their structure, was investigated. The copolymers with methyl methacrylate (MMA) had an intense colour and fluorescence, stable to solvents. The photostability of the dyes included in the polymer chain increased. The influence of the dyes on the phothostability of the inherently and \\\"in mass\\\" coloured polymers was established. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, wool used for bright whites and pastel shades is always bleached with hydrogen peroxide during processing to improve its colour, and bleaching is known to reduce photostability. This paper describes the effects of peroxide bleaching on two groups of Merino fleece wools having the same range of initial yellowness but differing photostabilities. After peroxide bleaching, there was no significant difference in photostability between the two groups, suggesting that genetic selection of sheep for higher photostability would only offer a commercial benefit for production of bright white and pastel shades if yellowness is reduced to such an extent that peroxide bleaching is unnecessary. A more viable short-term approach would be to use a water-soluble UV absorber to reduce the rate of photoyellowing, if a means of applying the UV absorber to bleached wool without reducing its whiteness could be achieved.\", \"Excipients can strongly influence the photostability of drug substances. In our investigations, the solvent used for drug solutions was found to cause differences in degradation kinetics and degradation products. Other excipients are also relevant for the photostability testing. UV absorbers and dyes often act as photostabilizing agents. On the other hand, excipients can also accelerate photodegradation processes. The latter fact implies that photostability testing for drug preparations is essential even if preliminary tests have proven satisfactory photostability for the drug substance alone.\", \"The photostability of eight blue-emitting derivatives of 2-aminoterephthalic acid, three of them containing a stabilizer residue in their molecule in dimethylformamide was investigated. Copolymerisation of methyl methacrylate with four of them, monomer compounds and whitening of methyl methacrylate \\\"in mass\\\" with one of the compounds was accomplished. The copolymers obtained have an intense stable to solvents fluorescence. Photostability of the compounds, thus included in the polymer chain increased. The influence of the luminophores on the photostability of the inherently and whitened \\\"in mass\\\" polymers was established. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The photostability is the amount of energy that can be deposited in the material before its luminescence or lasing intensity has dropped to 50% of the initial value. It is shown that the photostability can be prolonged by a factor 100 by reducing the oxygen content in the material. The realized oxygen removal procedure and encapsulation of the solid state dye does not affect the luminescence properties and thus might be applicable in dye lasers.

Up to five times increase in photostability of pyrromethene 567 in solid and two times in solution has been observed. The enhanced photostability is attributed to reduction in the effectiveness of in situ oxygen degradation of pyrromethene by the addition of the coumarin. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Disperse Yellow 232 and related heterocyclic compounds in ethanol, DMF and ethyl benzoate in the presence or absence of air was investigated. The lightfastness of the dyes on synthetic fibres was studied in relation to their photostability in the solvents. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.\", \"Photobleaching of fluorescent proteins (FPs) is a major limitation to their use in advanced microscopy, and improving photostability remains highly challenging due to limited understanding of its molecular mechanism. Here we discovered a new mechanism to increase FP photostability. Cysteine oxidation, implicated in only photobleaching before, was found to drastically enhance FP photostability to the contrary. We generated a far-red FP mStable by introducing a cysteine proximal to the chromophore. Upon illumination, this cysteine was oxidized to sulfinic and sulfonic acids, enabling mStable more photostable than its ancestor mKate2 by 12-fold and surpassing other far-red FPs. mStable outperformed in laser scanning confocal imaging and super-resolution structured illumination microscopy. Moreover, photosensitization to oxidize a cysteine similarly introduced in another FP mPlum also increased its photostability by 23-fold. This postfolding cysteine sulfoxidation cannot be simply substituted by the isosteric aspartic acid, representing a unique mechanism valuable for engineering better photostability into FPs.\", \"A quantitative study of the photostability of dye molecules, trapped in transparent solid matrices synthesized by the sol-gel technique and diluted in solutions, was carried out by measuring the average number B of photons that the dye molecules can absorb before getting bleached. The investigated dye molecules were: Perylene Red, Perylene Orange, Pyrromethenes 567 and 597, Rhodamines 6G and B, DCM, a xanthylium salt and Neon Red. Values of B from 10(3) to 10(9) were measured. We show that the photostability was largely enhanced when the molecules were trapped in solid matrices. The dye-doped matrices were used as gain media in pulsed lasers to see the influence of the photostability of the molecules on their degradation in this common application: other bleaching processes were then revealed.\", \"Emamectin benzoate, a macrocyclic lactone, can be used in low quantities to control arthropod pests, effectively. However, its poor photostability prevents its further use. To delay its photodegradation, novel acrylate-type polymeric nanoparticles were synthesized and tested as materials for improving pesticide photostability. N-acylated emamectin benzoate was synthesized via bonding emamectin benzoate to acrylamide. The resulting pesticide, containing the double bond linkage C=CN, was copolymerized with butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate by the emulsion polymerization method. The refined polymers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectroscopy, and result illustrated the pesticide was conjugated to the polymers. Atomic force microscope and dynamic light scattering analyses were also used for determining the average particle diameters of pesticidepolymer conjugates. Photostability tests showed that the nanoparticles obtained exhibited greatly improved photostability. Additionally, the laboratory toxicity tests demonstrated that the insecticidal effects of the novel emamectin benzoate formulation were better than those of the control pesticide formulation (emamectin benzoate EC).

These compounds show bathochromic shifts in the absorption and emission spectra, larger two-photon cross-section, and enhanced photostability in comparison to their open-chain analogues. In addition, a convenient method for the qualitative photostability measurement is proposed.\", \"The total rate constants of the reaction of six antioxidants with singlet oxygen were measured by fluorospectroscopy, and the effects of these antioxidants on the photostability of the dyes were also investigated kinetically. The results reveal that the six antioxidants are the effective quenches of singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) and on increase the photostability of the dyes. The power of metal chelates to quench O-1(2), is the strongest, and the chelates show the most effects on the photostability of the dyes. The photostability of the dyes has something to do with the relative amount of the antioxidant used.\", \"The photostability of the widely used autofluorescent proteins EGFP and EYFP and their fluorinated counterparts were compared by means of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. We analyzed the reduction of the apparent diffusional time in analogy to fluorescence quenching in which the 'photon concentration' is treated as the quencher concentration.\\nThe quantum yields of pholobleaching Phi(bl) of EYFP (6.1 x 10(-5)) and EGFP (8.2 x 10(-5)) are in agreement with the previously published values. Among the investigated mutants, EYFP has the highest photostability and there is an enhanced photobleaching in (2-F) Tyr-EYFP. It turns out that the chromophore fluorination has no significant influence on the photostability. (C) 2008 Elsevier BY.

The dye preservation properties of colored latex loaded with different types of dye were studied; preservation depended on the rate of dye diffusion and thus on the size of the dye molecules and the hardness of the polymer matrix in the latex particles. Hindered amine stabilizers (HAS) were used to improve the photostability of colored latex. The effect of HAS in colored latex was investigated both as an additive and as a comonomer. The photostability of latex particles containing a simple mixture of dye and HAS was improved with increasing HAS content up to 20% in particles. In the case of colored latex particles combined with HAS by a covalent bond, the optimal amount of HAS for photostability improvement was between 8 and 20%.\", \"Electron withdrawing groups at the 5-position of benzotriazole ultraviolet absorbers (UVA) surprisingly improve photopermanence despite weakening the intramolecular hydrogen bond believed to be responsible for photostability. These results, encountered in coatings, thermplastics, and solvents, contradict the assumption from the widely accepted view of UVA photostability that a stronger H-bond would generate a more stable UVA. Calculations suggest the involvement of a conical intersection in benzotriazole excited state deactivation and support a significant role for charge transfer. Modifications to the traditional model of UVA photostability are discussed which more fully consider electronic factors and molecular motions;other than H-transfer.\", \"Photostability is one of the most important characteristic of a dye for fluorescence microscopy. Recently we demonstrated that vitamins present in imaging media dramatically accelerate photobleaching of Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) and many other green fluorescent and photoactivatable proteins. Here we tested all vitamins of commonly used media (such as Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, DMEM) one-by-one and found that only two vitamins, riboflavin and pyridoxal, decrease photostability of EGFP. Thus, DMEM without riboflavin and pyridoxal can be used as an imaging medium, which ensures high photostability of GFPs at the expense of minimal biochemical disturbance. Then, we tested some antioxidants and found that a plant flavonoid rutin greatly enhances photostability of EGFP during live cell microscopy. In complete DMEM, rutin increased EGFP photostability up to the level of vitamin-depleted DMEM. Moreover, being added to vitamin-depleted DMEM, rutin was able to further suppress EGFP photobleaching. Potentially, new medium formulations can be widely used for fluorescence microscopy of GFP-expressing cells and model multicellular organisms in a variety of imaging applications, where photostability represents a challenge.\", \"Inspired by natural photosynthesis, we employed polymeric micelles to enhance the water solubility and photostability of hydrophobic metallo-tetraphenylporphyrin (metallo-TPP) by complexation with poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PEG-b-P4VP) via axial coordination. The structure and photochemical properties of the complex micelles were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and laser light scatting. The photostability and electron transfer ability of metalloporphyrins in the micelles were investigated under continuous irradiation. The results show that metallo-TPPs entrapped in the micellar cores possess higher photostability and better electron transfer ability. The hydrophobic metalloporphyrins remains active inside the micelles which is reminiscent of chlorophyll protein complex in photosynthesis. The use of micelle thus may provide a promising system on designing photocatalysts for targeting applications in solar energy conversion and photodynamic tumor therapy (PDT).\", \"Semiconductor polymer dots (Pdots) are emerging as an excellent fluorescent probe in biology and medicine. However, the photostability of Pdots can't meet the requirements of long term single-particle imaging and tracking applications. Here we describe the enhanced single-particle brightness and photostability of Pdots by using an efficient enzymatic oxygen scavenging system (OSS). Pdots with particle diameters of 21 nm and 43 nm (PFBT21 and PFBT43) were prepared by a nanoprecipitation method. Single-particle imaging and photobleaching were performed to investigate the effect of OSS on the per particle brightness and photostability of Pdots. Our results indicate that the single-particle brightness of the PFBT21 Pdots in OSS was enhanced nearly two times as compare to the PFBT21 Pdots in water. The photobleaching percentages of PFBT21 and PFBT43 in OSS were determined to be 29% and 33%, respectively. These values are decreased by 2-3 times as compared to those of the same Pdots in water, indicating the significantly improved photostability of Pdots by OSS. This study provides a promising approach for enhancing photostability of Pdots in long term single-particle tracking. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The enhanced photostability is attributed to the reduction of intramolecular motions that facilitate photodegraclation. We report the simultaneous detection of mobility and photostability of sol-gel encapsulated didodecyl3,3,3', 3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine (Dil) using single molecule spectroscopy. Fluorescence from Dil was resolved into parallel and perpendicular polarization components and separately detected. On the basis of the calculated fluorescence polarization, single Dil molecules were classified into \\\"tumbling\\\" and \\\"fixed\\\". Out of 212 molecules investigated, 52% were found to be fixed. For the first time, the mobility of a guest molecule in sol-gel silicate can be directly correlated with its own photostability. Both tumbling and fixed molecules have shown to exhibit nonuniform photostability, indicative of the very heterogeneous guest-host interactions within each subgroup. The survival lifetimes for the majority of the tumbling and fixed molecules were found to be 4.3 and 13.1 s, respectively, demonstrating unequivocally that fixed molecules exhibit a higher photostability than tumbling molecules. These results are in accordance with a recent study on rhodamine B encapsulated in dried sol-gel silicates.\", \"Optical limiting (OL) cycling performance and photostability of vanadyl phthalocyanines (VOPCS) and naphthalocyanines (VONCS) were studied. The results show that although vanadyl 2,11,20,29-tetra-tert-butyl-2,3-naphthalocyanine has. the most pronounced OL effect originally, it is not a promising OL material due to its poor photostability. Meanwhile, vanadyl 2,9, 16,23-etraphenoxy-29H, 31H-phthalocyanine is considered to be a potential OL material, owing to its considerable OL effect and good photostability.

It was found that the photostability did not increase with the increase of the central conjugated chain length and/or substituent groups on the heterocyclic ring. Using UV spectra data, we have found that the photostability of indolenine cyanine dyes in solution increased with increase of the E-T (30) values of solvents. The rate of singlet oxygen formation, and beta values in different solvents sensitized by the dye alone were measured using fluorescence spectra. Absolute photooxidation rate constants (k(r)) are calculated, based on the determined beta values and the decay rate of singlet oxygen (k(d)).

We show that a higher photostability of dimegine compared to photoditazine and radachlorin is determined both by their different chemical natures and by the fact that the aggregation ability of porphyrin dyes is higher than that of chlorine dyes, which in the solution leads to efficient formation of dimers and higher-order complexes.\", \"The colour and photostability of fibres are important qualities, particularly for the production of brilliant white and bright pastel shade products that are essential for new and rapidly expanding casual apparel markets. This chapter describes the evolution of the natural cream colour of wool, current methods of wool colour measurement and commercial treatments for improving colour, such as bleaching and fluorescent whitening. The photostability of wool, which is poor compared with cotton and synthetic fibres, is discussed together with aspects of its complex photochemistry, and the potential for achieving brighter, whiter wools with improved stability is presented.\", \"Although colloidal quantum dots (QDs) exhibit excellent photostability under mild excitation, intense illumination makes their emission increasingly intermittent, eventually leading to photobleaching. We study fluorescence of two commonly used types of QDs under pulsed excitation with varying power and repetition rate. The photostability of QDs is found to improve dramatically at low repetition rates, allowing for prolonged optical saturation of QDs without apparent photodamage. This observation suggests that QD blinking is facilitated by absorption et light in a transient state with a microsecond decay time.

The photostability of UV filters incorporated in these products must be preserved during its storing and application processes in order to achieve the claims about photoprotection of the commercial products. The photostability of avobenzone, one of the most common UVA filters in commercial sunscreens, is assessed in solvents intended for cosmetic formulations. The study is carried out by following the spectral behavior of avobenzone solutions under irradiation and after storing them in the dark. Different photobehaviors of the avobenzona are found in the selected solvents, some of which can be explained in the same way than in analytical solvents; but for others, the structural and physical properties of the solvents must be taken into account. The most appropriate solvents for ensuring the photostability of avobenzona are mineral oil and isopropyl myristate.\", \"The use of a solid-state dye laser for commercial applications has been limited largely by the poor photostability of the gain medium.

Photostability of fabricated layers was studied by spectroscopic ellipsometry within as-deposited as well as relaxed (annealed) layers. For irradiation, laser sources operating at three wavelengths in band gap region of the studied materials were employed. The results show that lowest values of photorefraction accompanied with lowest changes of band gap values were exhibited by Ge20As20Te60 thin films, which are therefore considered as the layers with highest photostability in relaxed state. The structure of the films is discussed based on Raman scattering spectroscopy data.\", \"Fluorescent proteins offer exceptional labeling specificity in living cells and organisms. Unfortunately, their photophysical properties remain far from ideal for long-term imaging of low-abundance cellular constituents, in large part because of their poor photostability. Despite widespread engineering efforts, improving the photostability of fluorescent proteins remains challenging due to lack of appropriate high-throughput selection methods. Here, we use molecular dynamics guided mutagenesis in conjunction with a recently developed microfluidic-based platform, which sorts cells based on their fluorescence photostability, to identify red fluorescent proteins with decreased photobleaching from a HeLa cell-based library. The identified mutant, named Kriek, has 2.5- and 4-fold higher photostability than its progenitor, mCherry, under widefield and confocal illumination, respectively.

The photodegradation reaction of these drugs molecules was explored using UV-vis spectrophotometery-based kinetic analysis and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Quantitative evaluation of the influence of beta-CD was judged based on the observed rate constant (k (obs)), half-life time (t (0.5)) and t (0.1) of the photodegradation reaction and the peak area of the corresponding analyte after photodegradation using HPLC separation. It has been demonstrated that the photostability of these selected imidazoline-based drugs has been enhanced upon forming inclusion complexes with beta-CD in aqueous media. Moreover, high consistency regarding the photostability enhancement was obtained using both techniques. Hypothetical structure for 1:1 inclusion complexes was proposed based on molecular mechanics calculations, which in turn provide an insight for the energetically preferential structure of the inclusion complexes. The results obtained demonstrate that beta-CD can be utilized as photostabilizer additive for enhancing the photostability of imidazoline-derived drugs molecules.\", \"A combined solution and solid state study was performed to describe the complexation chemistry of iodine with three highly fluorescent bis-1,8-naphthalimide dyes. The spectroscopic properties, photostability characteristics and the mechanism of interaction were investigated and discussed. The formed complexes were characterized stoichiometrically and structurally using ultraviolet-visible, mid- and far-infrared spectral techniques, as well as CHN elemental analyses. A remarkable change in the UV-Vis spectra was observed when the iodine acceptor was complexed with a 1: 2 stoichiometry. Far-IR measurements confirmed the formation of triiodide (I-3(-)). The formation constant, molar extinction coefficient and other spectroscopic data were also determined and discussed.

Hence, it is important to develop strategies that can enhance the photostability of P3HT and enhance the device performance. In this work, we report that preparing composites of P3HT with appropriate amounts of multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) results in superior photostability of P3HT. UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy have been used as primary tools to study the photostability of P3HT and its composites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the composites display dispersed CNTs being well coated by P3HT. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs along with SAED patterns reveal that P3HT coats the CNTs, which is the reason for superior dispersion of the composite. ESR spectroscopy was also performed to pursue and follow the degradation of P3HT. Ten weight percent of MWCNTs in P3HT was found to be the optimum loading amount that results in maximum photostability of the P3HT as compared to the other ratios. This:enhanced photostability of P3HT on preparing composites with MWCNT in addition to its easy processability directly from solution makes these composites immensely important for optoelectronic applications.\", \"Fluorescence applications requiring high photostability often depend on the use of solution additives to enhance fluorophore performance. Here we demonstrate that the direct or proximal conjugation of cyclooctatetraene (COT), 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol (NBA) or Trolox to the cyanine fluorophore Cy5 dramatically enhanced fluorophore photostability without otherwise affecting its native spectral characteristics.

Herein we report the preparation of novel hybrids of these inorganic matrices and piroxicam (PX), which was chosen as a model drug due to its instability to light. The hybrid materials were successfully prepared with high drug loading and then were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and FT-IR spectroscopy. Finally, in order to investigate the matrix effects on piroxicam photostability, the hybrids were subjected to spectrophotometric analysis as a function of light exposure time. The results highlighted that PX intercalation into montmorillonite markedly improves the drug photostability and that this matrix can be proposed as an excipient for drug photostability enhancement.\", \"Brightness and photostability are key parameters for fluorescent probes in optical imaging. This Letter describes Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) as a useful strategy to enhance the photostability of fluorescent nanoparticles. Small molecules as FRET acceptors were doped into semiconductor polymer dots (Pdots), yielding apparent suppression of their rapid photobleaching in single-particle imaging. For 20 nm-diameter particles, the photobleaching percentage decreased from 71.8% to 47.2% after dye doping, while the single-particle brightness remained unchanged. The photostability of large Pdots was also enhanced by FRET at the expense of a moderate decrease in per-particle brightness as compared to the pure Pdots. This study indicates that FRET is a facile, yet effective, approach to mediate the brightness and photostability of fluorescent nanoparticles. Considering the combined factors of brightness and photostability, the dye-doped Pdots of similar to 20 nm diameter are the most suitable for long-term imaging and tracking applications.

The purpose of this study was to prepare multivesicular liposomes (MVL) loaded with RB to enhance its photostability and intracellulaer photodynamic efficacy.\\nMethods: Four MVL-RB formulations were prepared by reverse phase evaporation technique using a double emulsion method. The photostability of RB in phosphate buffer and in MVL was studied by monitoring the change in its absorption spectra at different time points following photoirradiation at 550 nm. Photodynamic cytotoxicity, intracellular uptake and localization of the most photostable MVL-RB were studied on baby hamster kidney fibroblasts to evaluate its photodynamic efficacy, compared with free RB.\\nResults: MVL-RB demonstrated significantly slower photodegradation rates with 10-fold extended half-life compared with free RB in buffer (p < 0.05). The degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics. Photodynamic cytotoxicity studies revealed that MVL-RB increased cell mortality by 1.6 - 2.5-fold, compared to free RB, and this could be attributed to its enhanced intracellular uptake and different localization pattern in the cell, in addition to increased photostability.\\nConclusion: Loading RB in MVL is a promising approach to improve the photodynamic efficacy of RB, by enhancing its photostability and delivery into cells.\", \"The aim of our study was to investigate the photoprotective activity and photostability efficacy of sunscreen formulations containing Helichrysum arenarium, Sambucus nigra, Crataegus monogyna extracts and their combination.

While structure-guided rational design and directed evolution approaches have largely overcome early problems such as oligomerization, poor folding at physiological temperatures, and availability of wavelengths suitable for multi-color imaging, nearly all fluorescent proteins have yet to be fully optimized. We have developed novel methods for evaluating the current generation of fluorescent proteins and improving their remaining suboptimal properties. Little is yet known about the mechanisms responsible for photobleaching of fluorescent proteins, and inadequate photostability is a chief complaint among end users. In order to compare the performance of fluorescent proteins across the visual spectrum, we have standardized a method used to measure photostability in live cells under both widefield and confocal laser illumination. This method has allowed us to evaluate a large number of commonly used fluorescent proteins, and has uncovered surprisingly complex and unpredictable behaviors in many of these proteins. We have also developed novel methods for selecting explicitly for high photostability during the directed evolution process, leading to the development of highly improved monomeric orange and red fluorescent proteins. These proteins, most notably our photostable derivative of TagRFP, have remarkably high photostability and have proven useful as fusion tags for long-term imaging. Our methods should be applicable to any of the large number of fluorescent proteins still in need of improved photostability.\", \"Near-infrared heptamethine cyanine dyes were synthesized without substitution to the polyene chain but with various substituents on the indoleninium fragments.

Nevertheless, the photostability of this flavonoid under exposure to UV irradiation have not been investigated and it is well-known that the photochemical stability of this substance is essential for its activity. Therefore, in the present work was investigated the photostability of a propylene glycol solution of quercetin under forced exposure to UVB irradiation. The content of quercetin in each solution was determined quantitatively by HPLC, its ultraviolet spectra (UV-vis) and its antioxidant activity by DPPH center dot. The HPLC and DPPH center dot methods were validated and the results demonstrated that these methodologies are adequate and reliable to quantify quercetin and to determine its antioxidant activity, respectively.

Especially the high photostability of indigo has been the subject of intensive research. Recently, it was proposed that after photoexcitation an intramolecular proton transfer followed by a nonradiative relaxation to the ground state promote photostability. In indigo the hydrogen bond and the proton transfer occur between the opposing hemiindigo parts. Here, we provide experimental and theoretical evidence that a hydrogen transfer within one hemiindigo or hemithioindigo part is sufficient to attain photostability. This concept can serve as an interesting strategy towards new photostable dyes for the visible part of the spectrum.\", \"A new set of cyanine-indole dyes was synthesized, characterized by optical and cytotoxic properties and subsequently applied for live cell imaging. Furthermore, these dyes were postsynthetically linked covalently to the 2'-position of uridine anchors in presynthesized oligonucleotides using the copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition in order to evaluate their photostability and imaging properties in living cells. The nucleophilicity at position C-2 of the indole part of the dyes was elucidated as key for a new structure-activity relationship that served as a rational guide to improve the photostability and optical properties of these green-emitting dyes for live cell imaging of nucleic acids. While the photostability rises exponentially with decreasing nucleophilicity, thermal bleaching experiments confirmed an opposite trend supposing that the superoxide radical anion is mainly responsible for the photobleaching of the dyes. Furthermore, the cytotoxicities of the dyes were tested in HeLa cells and moderate to low LD50 values were obtained. This interdisciplinary strategy allowed us to identify one dye with excellent optical properties and even better photostability and decreased cytotoxicity compared to a cyanine-indole dye that bears an additional cyclooctatetraene group as a triplet state quencher.\", \"Effects of different ultraviolet (UV) absorbers (octabenzone and bumetrizole) on physical properties and photostability of bitumen were investigated.

Solubility experiments were carried out to evaluate the effect of CDs on PPs aqueous solubility. Loading capacities and encapsulation efficiencies of freeze-dried inclusion complexes were determined. Moreover, photostability assays for both inclusion complexes in solution and solid state were performed. Finally, two of the most widespread phytopathogenic fungi, Fusarium oxysporum and Botrytis cinerea, were chosen to examine the antifungal activity of free and encapsulated PPs. Results showed that encapsulation in CDs significantly increased the solubility and photostability of studied PPs (by 2 to 17-fold and 2 to 44-fold, respectively). Free PPs revealed remarkable antifungal properties with isoeugenol showing the lowest half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of mycelium growth and spore germination inhibition.

The quantum yield of as-prepared CdTe/CdS core/shell QDs without any post-preparative processing reached 58%. The experimental results illustrate that the QDs with core/shell structure show better photostability than thioglycolic acid (TGA)-capped CdTe QDs. The cyclic voltammograms reveal higher oxidation potentials for CdTe/CdS core/shell QDs than for TGA-capped CdTe QDs, which explains the superior photostability of QDs with a core/shell structure.

The evaluation of sunscreen photostability was performed by HPLC and spectrophotometric analysis, and degradation products were identified by GC-MS analysis. Components RES, BTC, OMC and AVO were significantly degraded after UV exposure (reduction of around 16% in recovery). According to HPLC analysis, all formulations presented similar photostability profiles. Eleven degradation products were identified in GC-MS analysis, among them products of RES, BTC, OMC and AVO photodegradation. All evaluated formulations were considered photoreactive, as well as the isolated compounds RES and AVO. Considering HPLC, spectrophotometric and GC-MS results, it is suggested that formulations containing BMZ were considered the most photostable. The combination RES + BTC in a sunscreen improved the photostability of AVO. The benefits of using a combination of antioxidants in sunscreens was demonstrated by showing that using RES + BTC + studied UV-filters led to more photostable formulations, which in turn implies in better safety and efficacy.

Results indicate morphologies of ZnO films can be tailored from nanoparticles to nanostructured networks and irregular aggregates at the micron scale with different crystallinities through specific combinations of reaction conditions. The photostability and antifungal performances of coated bamboo were greatly improved and highly dependent on both crystallinity and morphologies of ZnO films.\", \"Synthesis, photophysical properties, and photostability of 9,10-disubstituted anthracenes with fluorine-containing groups (FCG) are described. The values of Phi(f) and lambda(em) greatly go up by the meso-substitution with FCG, and a nice corelationship between Phi(f) and A(pi) (magnitude of pi conjugation length in the excited single state) is observed. The C6F5 group at the meso positions exhibits an excellent ability in the photostability as well as in the emission efficiency.\", \"A high quantum yield and an enhanced photostability was found for a europium(III) tetrakis(2-thenoyltrifluoroacetonate) complex after dissolving the complex in a weakly-coordinating imidazolium ionic liquid.\", \"Three hemicyanine dyes containing N-(carboxyethyl)-2-methylbenzothiazolium group and bearing different substituent in p-position of phenyl ring of styryl moiety were readily prepared by a Knoevenagel condensation. Their UV/Vis and fluorescence spectra, aggregation, photostability and association with bovine serum albumin were studied. The maximum absorption and emission wavelengths of the dyes in different solvents were in the range 520-620 nm. Compared with a typical N-alkyl-2-methylbenzothiazolium hemicyanine dyes, the introduction of carboxyethyl group reduced aggregation and improved molar extinction coefficient, and photostability in water.

The shelf life of drugs in daylight indoors was predicted with hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection as a model. The cumulative illuminance of unsteady daylight was measured with the patented pulse counting method in the experiment. The equivalent influences of light from different sources on the photostability of the model drug were observed. Results show that the daylight can be replaced by lamplight in photostability studies. The photodegradation of hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection obeys the zero order kinetics: c = c(O) - k(Et), and its shelf life in daylight indoors is about 1.1 years.

We report the synthesis of three highly photostable polymers (PDTBDT-BZ, PDTBDT-BZF, and PDTBDT-BZF(2)) and their suitability for use in high-performance OPV cells. Under 1 sunlight of illumination in air for 10 h, these polymer films demonstrated remarkably high photostability compared to that of PTB7, a representative polymer in the OPV field. While the PDTBDT-BZ, PDTBDT-BZF, and PDTBDT-BZF2 polymer films maintained 97, 90, and 96% photostability, respectively, a PTB7 film exhibited only 38% photo stability under the same conditions. We ascribed the high photostability of the polymers to both the intrinsically photostable chemical moieties and the dense packing of alkyl side chains and planar backbone polymer chains, which prevents oxygen diffusion into the PDTBDT-BZ films. This work demonstrates the high photostability of planar PDTBDT-BZ series polymers composed of photostable DTBDT and BZ moieties and suggests a design rule to synthesize highly photostable photovoltaic materials.\", \"Ubidecarenone, which has low photostability and is poorly absorbed in the intestine, was formulated into a novel powdered dosage form designated as a redispersible dry emulsion. In preparing the system, an oily solution containing the drug and a colorant emulsified in an aqueous solution of a surfactant (Pluronic F-68) were spray-dried with a suitable excipient. The resultant dry emulsion particles have good flow properties and readily release the oily droplets to form stable emulsions on rehydration. The redispersibility, i.e., the conversion to the original emulsion from the dry emulsion form, was found to be closely related to the viscosity of the oily carrier. The photostability of the drug dissolved in the oily carriers was much improved in the presence of colorants. The kinetics data for photolytic degradation of the drug in the dry emulsion particle were analyzed to clarify the effect of the amount of excipient and colorant on the photostability of the drug in the particle.\", \"Modified rhodamine 6G molecules (Rh-Al or Rh-Aln) with polymerizable double bonds had been copolymerized with 1,8-naphthalimide derivatives, In copolymers PRNAM, naphthalimide moieties are connected to rhodamine moieties at nitrogen atom of rhodamine moiety, and in copolymers PRNM naphthalimide moieties are connected to rhodamine moieties at ester group of rhodamine moiety. We report on their photostability in liquid solution and in solid film. The photodegradation kinetics of novel copolymers functionalized with laser dyes based on modified rhodamine 6G and 1,8-naphthalimide has been studied by UV-VIS absorption spectroscopy. The results show that the rates of the photofading reactions of these novel copolymers follow quasi-first-order. The photostability of the copolymers functionalized with laser dyes in solid films is better than that in solutions. The different type of the copolymer shows the different photostability.

Prominent among imaging methods are the methods based on the detection of fluorescence from the fluorophores with which objects under study are labeled. Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are very popular as genetically encoded fluorescent labels for lifetime imaging of target structures and processes in living systems. One of the key characteristics of FPs is their photostability, i.e., their resistance to photochemical reactions that quench the fluorescence signal. This review describes the currently known molecular mechanisms underlying photobleaching and the methods used to improve the photostability of fluorescent proteins.\", \"Ease of genetic encoding, labeling specificity, and high photostability are the most sought after qualities in a fluorophore for biological detection. Furthermore, many applications can gain from the fluorogenic nature of fluoromodules and the ability to turn on the same fluoromodules multiple times. Fluorogen-activating peptides (FAPs) bind noncovalently to their cognate fluorogens and exhibit enhanced photostability. Herein, the photostabilities of malachite green (MG)-binding and thiazole-orange-binding FAPs are compared under limiting-and excess-fluorogen conditions to establish distinct mechanisms for photostability that correspond to the dissociation rate of the FAP-fluorogen complex. FAPs with slow dissociation show evidence of dye encapsulation and protection from photo or environmental degradation and single-step bleaching at the single molecule level, whereas those with rapid dissociation show repeated cycles of binding and enhanced photostability by exchange of bleached fluorogen with a new dye. A combination of generalizable selection pressure based on bleaching, flow cytometry, and site-specific amino acid mutagenesis is used to obtain a modified FAP with enhanced photostability, due to rapid dissociation of the MG fluorogen. These studies shed light on the basic mechanisms by which noncovalent association can effect photostable labeling, and demonstrate novel reagents for photostable and intermittent labeling of biological targets.\", \"Photostability measurements have been made on thin films containing amorphous polycarbonate and an organic chromophore, 2-{3-Cyano-4-[3-(1-decyl-1H-pyridin-4-ylidene)-propenyl]-5,5-dimethyl-5H-furan-2-ylidene}-malononitrile. We find that the photodegradation quantum efficiencies for films containing 15 % chromophore loading by weight are similar to those with lower chromophore loadings. The photodegradation quantum efficiency dramatically decreases by more than 3 orders of magnitude when the films are encapsulated to minimise exposure to oxygen.\", \"The influence of different modifiers, P2O5, K2O, Al2O3, SiO2, CeO2, and ZrO2, on the optical properties and photostability of rutile titanium dioxide was studied. The research was aimed at obtaining pigmentary rutile titanium dioxide with the enhanced photostability. The optical properties such as brightness, white tone, and gray tone were improved when titanium dioxide samples were modified with zirconium instead of cerium. Titanium dioxide products modified additionally with Al2O3 displayed improved optical properties by comparison with appropriate titanium dioxide products lacking introduced aluminum. In comparison with unmodified material (Delta E* = 21.8), a considerable increase of the photostability of modified titanium dioxide was observed. The lowest photoactivity, in the range of Delta E* = 0.96-2.45, was measured for the TiO2-PKAlSiCe series. A selective leaching method and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were used to determine the distribution of modifiers in titanium dioxide materials. It was concluded that the differences in both photoactivity and optical properties of modified titanium dioxide depend on its phase composition.\", \"Photostability is one of the most vital challenges for organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs). With the incorporation of black phosphorus (BP), well known for self-healing and its superior property to regulate charge recombination, into CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites (MAPbI(3)/BP), the associated PSCs exhibit significant enhancement in photostability in addition to the photovoltaic (PV) performance. The MAPbI(3)/BP-based PSCs retain approximate to 94% of initial efficiency after 1000 h continuous white light LED illumination in a dry N-2 glovebox whereas their counterparts without the incorporation of BP decrease to approximate to 30%. Although BP has very small influence on the morphology and structure of the perovskite crystals, Pb-0 defects are effectively inhibited and hot carrier recombination is found to be retarded as confirmed by femtosecond optical spectroscopy. The utilization of the material to simultaneously inhibit Pb-0 defect formation and retard charge recombination, such as BP, is a promising strategy to enhance the photostability of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite-based PSCs and their siblings.\", \"The photostability of aromatic compounds in the presence of air is significantly improved through perfluoroalkylation of the corresponding aromatic cores and use of polyfluorinated solvents despite higher O-2 concentration in polyfluorinated solvents than in hydrocarbon solvents.\", \"Most of the near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent copper ion probes are coordination-based, and the fluorescence enhancement is between 10 and 20 folds. Herein, a novel NIR fluorescent dye named CSCN with excellent photostability and a reaction-based Cu2+ NIR probe named CSCN-Cu were reported. CSCN exhibited good photostability toward photo irradiation. CSCN-Cu showed lower background fluorescent interference and over 40-fold fluorescence enhancement in NIR region, it also exhibited good selectivity toward Cu2+ in Hepes solution.

Liposomal composition, concentration, pH, and ionic strength were varied. The photostability of riboflavin was found to increase in the presence of neutral and negatively-charged liposomes but to decrease in association with positively-charged liposomes. Furthermore, increasing the concentration of dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) in the composition of the liposomes resulted in an enhancement in the photostability of riboflavin such that at 5.8mM DMPC concentration a 2.3 fold increase in photostability was observed compared to control buffer solution. The pH of the medium influenced the photostability of riboflavin. However, the ionic strength of solution appeared to demonstrate no significant effect. The photodegradation reactions appeared to follow first-order kinetics in the presence and absence of liposomes.\", \"Wool surface and interior modification can impart favorable properties, such as felting/shrink resistance, settability, or improved affinity for dyes. However, in principle such modification may have an either beneficial or adverse effect on the subsequent photostability of the modified wool. In this study, a range of representative physical and chemical modification approaches including the use of helium gas plasma, papain, acylation with acid anhydride, and permanganate oxidation were applied to wool fabrics, and the subsequent effects characterized using scanning electron microscopy, FTIR-ATR, contact angle goniometry, fluorescence spectrophotometry, and tensile strength test. The relative photostability of control and treated wool were evaluated in terms of coloration changes under UVA, UVB, and blue light irradiation. We have shown that the subsequent photostability of modified wool fabrics is highly dependent on the modification type, and this factor should be carefully considered in the design and application of wool treatments.

Pyrromethene 567 has been successfully incorporated within silica: polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) Polycerams to obtain polishable, crack-free, transparent monoliths using the sol-gel process. Fluorescence photostability was measured by pumping with a Q-switched, frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser (532 nm) at a pulse rate of 10 Hz. Fluorescence intensity dropped to 50% after approximately 50,000 pulses at a fluence of 0.10 J/cm(2). UV degradation studies were performed on Polycerams with different polymer contents, and the absorption photostability is related to the solubility and type of caging of the dye.\", \"In single-molecule applications, the photostability of fluorescent molecules is a key parameter. We apply fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to compare the photostability of four fluorescein and four boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes of similar structure but different triplet yields. The latter class of dyes are more stable. In the kinetic analysis the, diffusion and photobleaching are treated as competitive processes. Corrections, which account for saturation and for experimental artefacts, are achieved solely by using experimental data. Photobleaching is found to occur mainly through the first excited singlet state S-1, in contrast to previous findings.\", \"Gold nanoparticles are mixed in aqueous solution of Rhodamine 6G to modify the lasing output intensity.

The result was a mineral oil suspension that included a photostabilized abamectin. After exposure to simulated sunlight, the microsphere suspension provided a several-fold increase in recoverable abamectin residue. The enhanced photostability of the microspheres is due to retarded reaction between oxygen and the diene chromophore of abamectin, in the presence of light. The zein could function as a quencher of singlet oxygen and/or a physical oxygen barrier.\", \"Desonide is a topical corticoid used in the treatment of skin diseases and is marketed in different pharmaceutical dosage forms. Recently, the poor photostability of a commercially available hair solution after direct exposure to UVA light was verified. In this study, we investigated the ability of the antioxidants ascorbic acid, butylhydroxyanisole (BHA), butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), alpha-tocopherol, and the UV filter benzophenone-3 (BP-3) to prevent the photodegradation of desonide in hair solution (desonide 0.1%) and the stability of the proposed formulation under environmental conditions. The tested antioxidants were not able to prevent the photolysis of desonide, whereas the addition of 0.3% BP-3 enhanced the photostability of the drug. After 15 h of direct exposure to UVA radiation, the desonide remaining content in the hair solution with BP-3 was approximately 98%. Higher photostability was also verified under UVC radiation. Additionally, the results indicated that the formulation was stable under accelerated and room temperature conditions for 70 days, corresponding to the total period of the study.\", \"Efficient UV-absorbing molecules are designed to protect against UV-light exposure. However, the development of photostable sunscreens is important to preserve the photoprotective efficacy and to prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and photodegradation products, which can promote phototoxic or photoallergic contact dermatitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of mangiferin and naringenin on the photostability and phototoxicity of sunscreens containing avobenzone. Cosmetic sunscreen formulations containing octocrylene (OCT), octyl methoxycinnamate (0MC) and avobenzone (AVO) were prepared and supplemented or not with mangiferin, naringenin, or with both compounds in combination. For photostability studies, samples of the formulations were spread onto glass plates, exposed to UVA radiation and then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine UV filters and the antioxidants recovery. The phototoxicity of the UV filters and antioxidants was evaluated using 3T3 fibroblast cultures that were subjected (or not) to irradiation according to OECD TG 432. The photostability studies demonstrated that AVO and naringenin showed the highest photodegradation when present in formulation FN (containing octocrylene, avobenzone, octyl methoxycinnamate and naringenin). The addition of mangiferin to this combination (FMN) resulted in an improved photostability of both substances compared to FN. The in vitro phototoxicity test showed that only avobenzone was considered phototoxic. The combination containing AVO/naringenin exhibited phototoxic potential; however, this was reduced by the addition of mangiferin (combination CMN). The results of this study are promising because it was demonstrated that mangiferin could increase the photostability and reduce the phototoxic potential of the combination of naringenin and AVO.

However, increase in the photostability of 4-methoxycinnamoyl moiety could be observed when esterified with alpha-CD and that of 2,4,6-trimethoxycinnamoyl moiety could be observed after being esterified with gamma-CD. These photostability data together with the 2D NMR analyses indicated that the 4-methoxycinnamoyl, 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamoyl and 2,4,6-trimethoxy cinnamoyl moieties could enter the alpha-CD, the beta-CD, and the gamma-CD cavities, respectively.

Their poor photostability has, however, limited their wide applications in bioimaging and biosensing schemes. Herein, we report the remarkable photostability enhancement of the porphyrin, carboxyphenyl porphyrin (TCPP-H-2) when locked in a zirconium based metal-organic framework (MOF-525). Steady-state ensemble fluorescence spectroscopy experiments showed minimal changes (2%) in the recorded signal when MOF-525 was continuously illuminated as compared to a 16% decrease for free porphyrins. Single particle fluorescence imaging revealed bright microparticles with exceptional photostability and no-blinking within the experiment window.

FTIR spectroscopy was used to monitor the hydrolysis reaction rates of the silylated dyes and other Si-alkoxide precursors. The silylated dyes had varying reaction rates depending on the degree of functionality and the linkage between the alkoxide and the dye. Matching the reaction rates between TMOS and the silylated dye was accomplished by prehydrolysis of the silylated dye. The photostability of the dyes in the xerogels was measured by monitoring the drop in fluorescence intensity upon pumping with a N-2 laser and also by monitoring the drop in dye absorption upon irradiating the films with a UV lamp. At optimized prehydrolysis times, a silylated coumarin dye (derCoum) within a SiO2 xerogel host demonstrated a 3-fold improvement in long-term photostability compared to its unsilylated counterpart. The use of a silylated dye results in covalently bonding the dye to the host matrix, increasing the probability that the dye will be caged and inhibiting dynamic processes which can lead to photodegradation. CP-MAS Si-29 NMR data for a derCoum xerogel confirmed that a large degree of dye bonding occurred. The addition of PDMS to the basic SiO2 xerogel host composition had little effect on the photostability of the dye. The neat dye films showed improved fluorescence photostability with increase in hydrolysis time. These films showed poor photostability upon exposure to UV lamp degradation due to lower thermal degradation resistance and/or thermal conductivity compared to the SiO2 xerogel films.\", \"Genetic parameters (heritability, phenotypic and genetic correlations) were estimated for a range of visual and measured wool traits recorded from the 2008 shearing of the initial cohort of Merino progeny born into the Sheep CRC's Information Nucleus Flock. The aim of this initial analysis was to determine the feasibility of selectively breeding Merino sheep for softer, whiter, more photostable wool and to quantify the likely impact on other wool production and quality traits. The estimates of heritability were high for handle and clean colour (0.86 and 0.70, respectively) and moderate for photostability (0.18), with some evidence of maternal effects for both handle and photostability. The phenotypic correlations between handle and clean colour and between handle and photostability were close to zero, indicating that achieving the 'triple' objective of softer, whiter, more photostable wool in the current generation through phenotypic selection alone would be difficult. There was evidence of an antagonistic relationship between handle and photostability (-0.36), such that genetic selection for softer wool will produce less photostable wool that will yellow on exposure to UV irradiation. However genetic selection for whiter wool is complementary to photostability and will result in whiter wool that is less likely to yellow. Genetic selection to improve handle, colour and photostability can be achieved with few detrimental effects on other visual and measured wool traits, particularly if they are included in an appropriate selection index.\", \"Beta-cyclodextrin polymers (pbCD) cross-linked by epichlorohydrin (pbCDE) and citric acid (pbCDC) were prepared in this work. The inclusion complexes of pbCDE and pbCDC with curcumin and two commercial UV filters, 2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate (EHMC) and 4-tert-butyl-4'-methoxydibenzoylmethane (DBM) were investigated. The UV absorption of these three compounds observed in water indicated that the water solubility of these three hydrophobic compounds increased. The amount of EHMC was higher in both pbCDE and pbCDC than curcumin and DBM, respectively. The photostability of these three compound inclusion complexes with pbCDE and pbCDC were also studied in water and ethylene glycol. It was found that the photostability of the three compounds improved upon formation of the inclusion complex with pbCDE in an aqueous and ethylene glycol solution. The acidity of the crosslink moiety effects to the inclusion complex formation and the photostability of the guests suggesting that more acidity of citric acid decreased the formation and stability of all guest compounds.\", \"Triplet triplet-annihilation-based upconversion (TTA-UC) imaging boasts a low-excitation irradiance and an uncanny lack of autofluorescence interference. Because of these promising features, this approach has been the subject of intensifying investigation. Despite the ideal features, the classical approach of TTA-UC imaging suffers from some crucial drawbacks. A major deficiency of the system lies within its poor photostability, especially for a near-IR-excitation system. Here we report a reduction strategy to improve the TTA-UC photo stability. The poor photostability of TTA-UC can be attributed to singlet oxygen generation by the sensitizer under irradiation. We control the singlet oxygen by including a reductive solvent, which consumes the singlet oxygen, thereby improving the TTA-UC photostability. We also prepared TTA-UC nanocapsules with reductive solvent soybean oil inside. In comparison to nonreductive solvents such as toluene, our system shows a significant enhancement to the TTA-UC photostability. The prepared TTA-UC nanocapsules were then used for whole-animal deep imaging with a high signal-to-noise ratio.\", \"Intercalation of the dianion of the anthraquinone dye Acid Green 28 (1,4-bis[(4-butylbenzene-2-sulphonate)amino]-5,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone) (AG28(2-)) into a Zn2Al-layered double hydroxides (LDH) has been carried out by an anion-exchange method in an effort to improve its thermostability and photostability. The interlayer distance of the LDH was 1.918 nm after reaction with AG28(2-) anions, confirming their intercalation into the interlayer galleries of the LDH host. Infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis revealed the presence of host-guest interactions between LDH layers and AG28(2-) anions. The thermostability of AG28 as its sodium salt and Zn2Al-AG28-LDH were compared by thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis and UV-visible spectroscopy. It was found that the thermostability of AG28 was markedly improved by intercalation into the Zn2Al-LDH host, whilst the photostability was enhanced slightly. In their composites with polyethylene, it was also found Zn2Al-AG28-LDH possessed better thermostability and photostability than AG28 as its sodium salt. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

While physical confinement remains the major factor that controls mobility in modified alcogels, both R6G mobility and photostability register discernible changes after surface charges are respectively reversed and neutralized by aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTs) and methyltriethoxysilane (MTES) grafting to weaken R6G/silica attraction oil pore surfaces. Among the two methods, the change in R6G photostability was found to be more sensitive to surface grafting, which is more capable of inducing localized dynamic motions than full scale molecular rotation under the stringent physical confinement inside alcogel films. In addition, silica films modified by 0.4% APTS is as efficient as that by pure MTES in lowering R6G photostability, Suggesting that Surface charge reversal is more effective than charge neutralization in disrupting R6G/silica attraction. Collectively, our results demonstrate that single-molecule mobility and photostability can be used to monitor the extent of grafting reaction Underneath a film Surface and complement other surface characterization techniques that are only sensitive to modifications made oil a film surface.\", \"Effect of acidity of a medium on the spectroscopic characteristics of riboflavin aqueous solutions is investigated by the method of fluorescent and absorption spectroscopy. Significant deformation of the electronic spectra of riboflavin aqueous solutions irradiated with unfiltered light of a PRK-2 lamp is observed.

The photostability of the DCM-doped materials under CW argon laser irradiation was investigated. The absorption of DCM monomer ar 480 nm decreased with increasing irradiation time and was accompanied by an increase in the absorption at 352 nm by inactive photoproducts. Photostability was estimated by measuring the decay rates of DCM fluorescences in different host matrices. The rates exhibited two components; a rapid decay within the first several tens of seconds followed by a slower luminescence decay. The rapid decay depended upon the DCM content in the matrix while the slow decay component was related to the mobility of the DCM in the different matrices. The silica host matrix containing phenyl and a small amount of epoxy groups exhibited the best photostability of the materials examined.\", \"Absorption and emission spectroscopic techniques have been applied in this study to elucidate die photophysical properties of oxazine dye molecules.

Here we report a comparative study on the photostability assessment of two commercial sunscreens with same SPF, spread onto glass plates or onto full thickness pig ear skin or human/pig SCE membranes, and exposed to 183 kJ/m(2) UVA. Absorbance spectra and lipid peroxidation (measured by TBARS production) were determined. The results indicate: (a) sunscreen performance consequent to UVA exposure is independent of whether it is spread onto a non-biological and chemically inert substrate such as glass, or on biological substrates such as skin/SCE membranes; (b) despite the same SPF, sunscreen performance and photostability can be very different; (c) the data on human SCE membranes are similar to those on pig SCE membranes, indicating the suitability of the latter as a model for human skin. However, since the results obtained using skin membranes, akin to the more realistic conditions of use in vivo, do not substantially differ from those obtained on glass plates, the method proposed here using the latter may be applied for rapid, inexpensive, efficacy screening of photostability of sunscreens. Photostability testing should be a mandatory requirement for safer sunscreen protection products, since the results clearly show that some are still far from perfect. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To find out the related factors in the QD photostability, the photobleaching of naked CdTe QDs and BSA coated CdSe/CdS/ZnS QDs in human hepatocellular carcinoma (QGY) cells and human nasopharynx carcinoma (KB) cells were studied under single photon excitation (SPE) and two-photon excitation (TPE). In these two cell lines the cellular QDs were irradiated by a 405 nm continuous wave laser for SPE or an 800 nm femto-second (fs) laser for TPE. The QD photobleaching with the irradiation time was found to fit a biexponential decay. The fast decay plays a dominant role in the bleaching course and thus can be used as the parameter to quantitatively evaluate the QD photostability. The TPE decreased the QD photobleaching as compared to SPE. The BSA coated core/shell QDs had improved the photostability up to 4-5 times than the naked QDs due to the shielding effect of the QD shell. Therefore, it is better to use core/shell structured QDs as the fluorescence probe combining with a TPE manner for those long-term monitoring studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Although sunscreens are regulated in most countries, photostability testing is not mandatory. Because of the ability of sunscreen ingredients to absorb UV-light and the complexity of most of these formulations, which may include more than one UV-filter, antioxidants and other formulation excipients, it is important that their photostability in combination is determined.

Because long alkyl chains may adversely affect the performance of QD devices that require fast and efficient charge transfer, shorter aromatic ligands are of increasing interest. In this work, we characterize the formation of phenyl dithiocarbamate (DTC) adducts on CdSe surfaces and the relative effectiveness of different para-substituted phenyl dithiocarbamates to enhance the aqueous photostability of CdSe QDs on TiO2. Optical absorption and photoluminescence measurements show that phenyl DTC ligands can be highly effective at reducing QD photocorrosion in water, and that ligands bearing electron-donating substituents are the most effective. A comparison of the QD photostability resulting from use of ligands bearing DTC versus thiol surface-binding groups shows that the DTC group provides greater QD photostability. Density functional calculations with natural bond order analysis show that the effectiveness of substituted phenyl DTC results from the ability of these ligands to remove positive charge away from the CdSe and to delocalize positive charge on the ligand.\", \"To develop long wavelength cyanine dyes with good water solubility and high photostability for biological application, a series of heptamethine 5-sulfo-3H-indocyanine dyes were synthesized and characterized.

The photostability of the filters tested was evaluated by comparing the amount of filters recovered from the strippings of UV-irradiated skin (40 minimal erythema close, or MED) versus non-irradiated skin. Sequential analysis of several successive tapes reflected the distribution profile of the filters in the stratum corneum. Photochemical change was observed for one filter: it was shown to undergo a photochemical modification with the appearance of an additional HPLC peak. Moreover, UV filters tested displayed a high affinity for the stratum corneum but presented different distribution profiles.\\nThis in vivo method takes into account the interaction of the sunscreen agents with the stratum corneum. Furthermore, unlike spectrometric methods usually used for photostability assessment, it gives quantitative data for each individual filter of a finished product by using an HPLC technique.\", \"The formulation and the manufacturing process can significantly influence the photostability of tablets.

However, there is very little investigation into the molecular processes of degradation, which is critical to guiding design of novel NFAs for long-lived, commercially viable OPVs. Here, the important role of molecular structure and conformation in NFA photostability in air is investigated by comparing structurally similar but conformationally different promising NFAs: planar O-IDTBR and nonplanar O-IDFBR. A three-phase degradation process is identified: i) initial photoinduced conformational change (i.e., torsion about the core-benzothiadiazole dihedral), induced by noncovalent interactions with environmental molecules, ii) followed by photo-oxidation and fragmentation, leading to chromophore bleaching and degradation product formation, and iii) finally complete chromophore bleaching. Initial conformational change is a critical prerequisite for further degradation, providing fundamental understanding of the relative stability of IDTBR and IDFBR, where the already twisted IDFBR is more prone to degradation. When blended with the donor polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene), both NFAs exhibit improved photostability while the photostability of the polymer itself is significantly reduced by the more miscible twisted NFA. The findings elucidate the important role of NFA molecular structure in photostability of OPV systems, and provide vital insights into molecular design rules for intrinsically photostable NFAs.\", \"Fullerene (C-60) enhanced mesoporous CdS/TiO2 architectures were fabricated by an evaporation induced self-assembly route together with an ion-exchanged method.

The photocatalytic activity and photostability of ZnO nanoparticles coated with TiO2 layers by ALD and chemical methods were examined by the photodegradation of Rhodamine B dye under UV irradiation. Even though the photo-catalytic activity of the presynthesized ZnO nanoparticles is higher than that of commercial P25 TiO2 nanoparticles, their activity tends to decline due to severe photocorrosion. The chemically synthesized TiO2 coating layer on ZnO resulted in severely declined photoactivity despite the improved photostability. However, ultrathin and conformal ALD TiO2 coatings (approximate to 0.75-1.5 nm) on ZnO improved its photostability without degradation of photocatalytic activity.

We found that risperidone was unstable in tablets and generated oxidized products. Formation of the oxidized product R5 was promoted in the presence of hydroxypropylcellulose by photoirradiation. On the other hand, photostability improved greatly when carmellose (CMC) or carmellose calcium (CMC-Ca) was used as a disintegrant. Since CMC and CMC-Ca are acidic substances, the photostability of tablets may have been affected by pH. Therefore, the effects of different pHs were examined. Risperidone was dissolved in methanol and the buffer (in the presence or absence of hydroxypropylcellulose) at different pHs (1.2, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.8) was added. The photodegradation of risperidone was not observed at less than pH 3.0 in the presence of hydroxypropylcellulose, and low pHs improved the photostability of risperidone. On the other hand, risperidone solution without hydroxypropylcellulose was stable at all pH values.

Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated 2.04- and 3.41-fold increments in AUC and C-max, respectively in comparison to MTX powder. The AUC and C-max were significantly increased in solid SMEDDS.

The photostability studies were carried out on inclusion complexes of rac-nicardipine with alpha-cyclodextrin (alphaCD), beta-cyclodextrin (betaCD), gamma-cyclodextrin (gammaCD), hydroxypropyl-alpha-cyclodextrin (HPalphaCD), hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD), hydroxypropyl-gamma-cyclodextrin (HPgammaCD), (2-hydroxyethyl)-beta-cyclodextrin (HEbetaCD) and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD). A photoprotective effect was observed by betaCD, HPalphaCD, HEbetaCD, whereas gammaCD, MbetaCD, HPbetaCD and HPgammaCD did not affect the nicardipine photostability. Conversely, alphaCD was found to favour the drug photodegradation.\\nEvidences for CDs-mediated stereoselective photodegradation of rac-nicardipine were observed only for the beta-CD complex. In this case, two distinct photodegradation profiles, with two different kinetic constants (k), were observed for the nicardipine enantiomers. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Monofluorinated dyes are synthesized with low yields (<30%), however trifluoromethyl derivatives are obtained in moderate to high yields (approximate to 40-90%). All compounds are characterized by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, the photostability is investigated with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF). Monofluorination hardly affects the spectroscopic parameters of the unsubstituted parent compounds, but distinctly enhances the photostability, whereas trifluoromethylation leads to a hypsochromic shift by up to 17nm in both absorption and emission, slightly enhanced intersystem crossing, and higher photostability. Further development of soft fluorination and trifluoromethylation methods is therefore highly desired.\", \"Laser dye coumarin 440(C440) is codoped with pyrromethene 567 (PM567) into polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The effects of C440 concentration on the performance of the solid state dye medium, including spectra property, slope efficiency and photostability, are studied. When C440 is codoped with PM567 at the same concentration 1 x 10(-4) mol/L, the highest efficiency and photostability can be obtained. Compared with the medium based on pure PM567 doped PMMA, about 50% increase in slope efficiency and at least five-fold enhancement in the photostability are observed.\", \"Physicochemical parameters, epsilon, lambda, solubility in water and Brij-35, pKa, K-a and photostability for dihydroeuparin, 5-acetyl-2, 3-dihydro-6-hydroxi-2-isopropenyl-benzo (b) furan (from Senecio Graveolens), were obtained and compared to those of o-hidroxyacetophenone. Its sunscreen capabilities, SPF and SSPF, were obtained for both compounds and compared to those of homomenthylsalicylate (homosalate). Results indicate that dihydroeuparin has sunscreen behavior at 270-340 nm zone, with high photostability, high solubility in miscellar system, apparently is a non-toxic substance and shows higher sunscreen capabilities than homosalate.\", \"The results of studies and comparative analysis of thermal properties and photostability of zinc(II) complexes with tetramethyl- and tetraphenyl-substituted dipyrrins and tetraphenyl-meso-azadipyrrin are reported. The thermal decomposition of complexes starts in the temperature range between 293 and 481A degrees C depending on the molecular structure. Tetraphenyl-substituted zinc(II) dipyrrinate shows the highest photoand thermal stability. The substitution of phenyl moieties in the ligand structure with methyl groups and replacement of the methine spacer with a nitrogen atom reduces thermal stability and photostability of the complexes.\", \"Sunscreens like 4-tert-butyl, 4-methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMDM) exhibit poor photostability, when exposed to sunlight. Conventionally, photostability of BMDM and other sunscreens can be determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or spectroscopic methods. We have developed a rapid, easy screening, and potentially high-throughput high-performance thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) method for quantifying the photostability of BMDM in the presence of known stabilizers/other chemical ingredients. The method is based on spotting the silica gel coated HPTLC plates (in duplicate) with the sunscreen molecules of interest along with a known photostabilizer. The plate is then exposed to solar simulated sunlight for a specific time. Ascending chromatography was performed in a thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) chamber using n-hexane ethyl acetate 9:1 (v/v) as the mobile phase (similar to 10 mL). Densitometric analysis was done to determine the amount of sunscreen that remained after solar exposure. This method also involves separation of sunscreens and their photodegraded products on the HPTLC plate. The results obtained with this method were compared well with those obtained with the conventional method.\", \"4-Iodo-, 4,4'-, and 5,5'-dibromo-substituted BF2-dipyrrinates (BODIPY) have been prepared, and their spectral luminescent properties and photostability have been studied. It has been shown that the introduction of iodine and bromine atoms in the molecule structure results in build-up of the BODIPY phosphorescence and decrease in their fluorescence quantum yield. Basing on the obtained data, the prepared dipyrrinates can be recommended for development of fluorescent sensors for medical and technical applications.\", \"The nanosized TiO2 in the rutile phase was coated by amorphous silica in ultrasonic field using sodium silicate as raw material. The prepared samples were characterized by FTIR, XPS, TEM and XRD techniques. The photostability and dispersivity of nanosized TiO2 were also evaluated. According to the spectra of FTIR and XPS, it was inferred that the Ti-O-Si bond was formed at the interface of the coating layer and the surface of nanosized TiO2 particles. The TEM images, surface elemental analysis and photostability experiment showed that a uniform dense coating layer on the surface of nanosized TiO2 was produced, and that the homogeneity and densification of coating layer were improved from ultrasonic field treatment. The dispersivity, UV shielding property and transparency of nanosized TiO2 in water were enhanced due to the dense coating of silica. The increase of m(SiO2): m(TiO2) promoted the photostability of nanosized TiO2. But while the m(SiO2):m(TiO2) was higher than 1:5, the photostability was nearly unchanged, and the growth of the crystal grains was effectively suppressed in the process of heat treatment.\", \"Photoluminescence (PL) and photostability measurements have been made on thin films containing the 2nd order nonlinear optic chromophore, PYR-3, and amorphous polycarbonate (APC). We find that the PYR-3 singlet excited state PL lifetime systematically decreases with increasing PYR-3 concentration, which may be due to PYR-3 excited state energy transfer to non-radiative decay sites. There is no correlation between the PL lifetime and the photostability for low optical intensities, and we find that the photobleaching data cannot be modeled with a single photodegradation quantum efficiency. There is an increase in the photostability with increasing optical intensity, and this enhancement is larger for high PYR-3 concentrations. It can be explained by a reduction in the oxygen content by oxygen-mediated photodegradation for the 5% PYR-3/APC films. This also partly explains the enhancement in the 15% PYR-3/APC films, but there is an additional mechanism as well. The photostability can also be improved by adding beta-carotene, which leads to an enhancement factor of greater than 6. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

This inclusion complex exhibited ultrastable photostability with good mitochondria-staining capability.\", \"Solid-state dye lasers based on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) doped with Pyrromethene 567 dye (P567) have been investigated The preparation techniques employed provided high photostability and laser damage threshold for P567 in pure PMMA with 270,000 pulses emitted before the conversion efficiency fell to half its initial value for a pump fluence of 0.16 J cm(-2). When PMMA was modified with 1,4-diazobicyclo [2,2,2] octane singlet oxygen quencher, the longevity increased to 550,000 pulses, corresponding to a normalized photostability of 270 GJ mol(-1). Modification of PMMA with a triplet quencher (perylene) yielded no improvement, but in ethanol solutions both additives enhanced photostability. It is possible that in PMMA, stabilization by means of triplet quenching that depends on dye diffusion is prevented. but that stabilization by means of singlet oxygen quenching that depends on the faster oxygen diffusion rate will succeed.

Photostabilizing dyes based on aroylenbenziwidazol derivatives used in polycaproamide and polyethylenterephthalate are discussed. The photostabilizing action of the above dyes is related to their own photostability and is manifested through UV-shielding, quenching of excited states of the polymer and inhibition of photooxidative reactions.\", \"Tenoxicam, a thienothiazine oxicam, is a potent anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic drug. A comprehensive study on the photostability of tenoxicam is presented, including a comparison of three different methods (HPTLC/densitometry, HPLC, CE) developed for the photostability testing of the title compound. The stability indicating capability of the respective assays is proven with sample solutions forcedly degraded by artificial irradiation from a xenon source. The chromatograms and the electropherogram of the resulting solution, show tenoxicam well resolved from the degradation products. The methods are applied for testing the photostability of solutions containing tenoxicam in various concentrations (2 mg mL(-1); 250 mug mL(-1); 40 mug mL(-1)), and stored under different conditions. The stability of tenoxicam was found to be dependent on the nature of the light source, as well as on the concentration of the sample solution. The assays are validated and compared with respect to performance and precision.\", \"In conjugated polymer based photovoltaic devices, efficient charge transfer and photostability of the fluorescence polymer are two essential properties, which could be responsible for better performance and longer lifetime of the device. Hence, it is of great importance to explore strategies that can enhance the exciton separation and improve the photostability of polymers. In this work, composites of poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) participated by appropriate amounts of reduced graphene oxide (r-GO), which leads to a significant photoluminescence quenching as well as superior photostability of MEH-PPV, have been investigated. The photoluminescence quenching and photostability of MEH-PPV/r-GO composites have been observed by UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy. From transient fluorescence spectrum, the mechanism of photoluminescence quenching has been confirmed to be static quenching, which is caused by electron transfer at the interface of the composite. Furthermore, we propose that this very efficient photoinduced excitation electron transfer from MEH-PPV to r-GO results in protecting MEH-PPV from further chemical degradation reaction. This work shows that graphene is promising as both an electron acceptor and light stabilizer for applications in optoelectronics devices.\", \"Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and photostability were studied for several core/shell-type semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) of CdTe/CdS, In(Zn)P/ZnS and CdZnS/ZnS using a TRPL microscopy at a single QD level, of which results were compared to that of CdSe/ZnS QD. The CdTe/CdS and In(Zn) P/ZnS QDs show unstable PL at a single QD level on both bare and polymer-coated glass coverslips, so that they mostly lose emissions within a few seconds. The CdZnS/ZnS QD shows better emission stability than those of the former two QDs, but still less stable than the case of the CdSe/ZnS.\", \"The photostability of melatonin, a hormone used as supplementary drug in the alleviation of jet-lag and other sleep disorders, was studied. The drug photodegradation at different pH values was monitored by HPLC methods. The main photoproduct was isolated and characterised on the basis of the NMR, FTIR, and mass spectra.

Absorption and emission spectroscopic techniques are applied to study some dye molecules: fluorescein, eosine, erythrosine, rhodamine B, rhodamine 6G, acridine orange, alone and in solution (polyethylene glycol 400, 600, 700), in order to establish the changes in photochemical properties (photostability) of these dyes, which could be used for fluorescent solar concentrators.\", \"The photostability of poly(vinyl chloride), PVC, containing various Schiff base metal complexes (0.5% by weight) was investigated. Various indices corresponding to a number of functional groups were monitored with irradiation of polymeric films to determine their photostabilization activities. The quantum yield of the chain scission (phi cs) of modified polymeric films was found to be (1.15-4.65) x 10(6). The surface morphology of a PVC sample was investigated by the use of atomic force microscope (AFM). The photostability of PVC films in the presence of Schiff base additives was found to follow the following order: PVC < PVC + CuL2 < PVC + CdL2 < PVC + ZnL2 < PVC + SnL2 < PVC + NiL2. Various mechanisms for PVC films photostability containing the Schiff base additives have been suggested.\", \"The water-soluble inclusion complexes of curcumin, 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate (EHMC) and 4-tert-butyl-4'-methoxydibenzoylmethane (DBM) with gamma-cyclodextrin polymer (pyCD) were successfully prepared and characterized by 1 H-NMR, IR and UV-Vis spectroscopies. The water-solubility of EHMC-pyCD, DBM-pyCD and curcumin-pyCD was dramatically increased because of the water-soluble pyCD. The mole ratio of gamma-CD in pyCD to EHMC, DBM and curcumin were carried out as 1:1. The photostability of all inclusion complexes was investigated in water and ethylene glycol and compared with free active ingredients. It was found that the photostability of EHMC-pyCD was greatly enhanced whereas those of DBM-pyCD and curcumin-pyCD in water were decreased due to the acceleration of the photodegradation reaction inside the gammaCD cavity. These results were able to be used as a solubilizer for cosmetic and also pharmaceutical applications.\", \"Photostability is a key characteristic of fluorescent proteins. It was recently demonstrated that green fluorescent protein (GFP) photobleaching in live cells can be suppressed by changes in medium composition. Here we show that Ham's F12 medium provides very high enhanced GFP (EGFP) photostability during fluorescence microscopy of live cells. This property of Ham's F12 medium is associated with decreased concentrations of riboflavin and pyridoxine, and increased concentrations of FeSO4, cyanocobalamine, lipoic acid, hypoxanthine, and thymidine compared with DMEM. We also found that the rate of EGFP photobleaching strongly depends on cell growth conditions such as cell density and the concentration of serum. We conclude that both imaging medium composition and the physiological state of the cells can strongly affect the photostability of fluorescent proteins. Thus, accurate comparison of the photostabilities of fluorescent proteins should be performed only in side-by-side analysis in identical cell growth conditions and media.\", \"Background: Drugs photostability plays two different opposite roles; a real advantage arises considering the longer expiration time of the drugs while the consequent persistence in the environment involves an obvious negative effect bound to their harmfulness.\\nOn this basis we tested the photostability and toxicity of three pharmaceutical active principles: Finasteride, Diclofenac and Naproxen. The pure active principles, as well as commercial drugs containing them, were considered; for the last, the protective effect of the packaging was also evaluated. Samples were irradiated according to the ICH Guidelines for photostability testing (The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use); a simulating sunlight source (a mercury-vapor lamp coupled to a tungsten filament one) was used to cover the wavelength range 300-2000 nm; Temperature, Relative Humidity, Irradiance and Illuminance were maintained constant during the photodegradation. The concentrations of the pharmaceutical active principles during the photodegradation were monitored by HPLC with UV/Vis detector. Toxicity tests were performed by means of an amperometric biosensor based on suspended yeast cells. Since the products obtained by the photodegradation process can result as toxic or more toxic than the original molecules, tests were performed first and after the photodegadation.\\nResults: After 90 hours of exposure the concentration resulted lowered by 42.9%, 88.4% and 91% for Finasteride, Naproxen and Diclofenac respectively. Toxicity of the pure active principles follows the same order of the photostability. After photodegradation a contribute of the reaction products was evidenced.\\nConclusions: The simple and cheap analytical procedure here proposed, allowed to obtain not only data on photostability and toxicity of the pure active principles but, even if roughly, also useful information on the reactions kinetic and toxicity of the photodegradation products.\", \"Organic-inorganic hybrid materials synthesized via sol-gel processing are excellent solid matrices for photochromic dyes like spirooxazine, and the photochromic performance can be further enhanced by introducing suitable additives. This work describes the effects of additives on the photochromic intensity (Delta A(0)), decolouration rate (k) and photostability of spirooxazine in sol-gel derived organic-inorganic hybrid matrices. They include fluoroalkylsilane (FAS), bisphenol A (BPA) and methyl-imidazole (MI). FAS enhances both Delta A(0) and photostability, but has little effect on k. The higher the content of BPA, the higher the Delta A(0) and the higher the photostability, but the lower the k. The effect of MI on Delta A(0) and k is not so considerable as that of BPA and is a little complicated, while significant improvement in photostability is achieved by the addition of MI at an optimum concentration with the presence df BPA at a higher content.\", \"Lasing properties of two dyes in polymeric matrix radiating in blue-green region of the spectrum pumped by a XeCl laser are studied.

Guest/host-mixtures of the dyes were prepared using a liquid crystal and a reactive mesogen mixture. Their dichroism was studied using linearly-polarized UV/Vis-spectroscopy. A strong dependence of the dichroic ratio on the aspect ratio, the number of double bonds in the molecular structure, and on the maximum wavelength of absorption was found. A strategy to increase the aspect ratio has also been demonstrated. Additionally, the photostability was characterized using continued irradiation with polychromatic light from a xenon source. High photostability was found in all host mixtures in the absence of oxygen by alignment in a matrix. The suitability for their application as dichroic dyes in thin layer polarizers and guest/host-displays is herein discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Up to now, in vitro techniques have been mainly proposed to evaluate photostability. These techniques have generated controversial debates concerning the predictive value of these in vitro observations in relation to the in vivo reality during sun exposure.\\nMethods: Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) is a recently developed technique that allows measurement of the UVA efficacy of sunscreen products in vivo on human volunteers. The absorption spectrum of the product is obtained by measuring the change in reflection of the skin with and without product. From this absorption spectrum, the UVA protective efficacy of the test product can be calculated for an appropriate source and a given biological action spectrum. We have used the DRS technique in vivo to determine the photostability of sunscreen products by measuring reflection spectra in the UVA range (320-400 nm) before and after product application and before and after UV exposure of the test products. Comparison between these spectra or between the corresponding calculated UVA protection factors has made it possible to determine the remaining level of protection in the UVA range after exposure. This study was designed to compare in vivo the protective efficiency and the photostability of three marketed sunscreen products (SPF 23-30) after solar-simulated exposure for SPF testing or after actual sun exposure. These in vivo data were then compared to in vitro photoinstability results.\\nResults: According to the in vitro measurements, one sunscreen product was found photostable and two products photo-unstable. After UVe exposure for in vivo SPF determination, a decrease in UVA absorption and UVA-PF was observed for the two photo-unstable products, while the photostable product did not present any decrease in UVA absorption. These results were confirmed through exposure to actual sun.\\nConclusion: Our study confirms the prediction of the in vitro methods previously used to assess the photostability of sunscreen products. In addition, DRS provides a powerful new tool for the in vivo simultaneous evaluation of photostability and estimation of the UVA protection factor of sunscreen products performed during the test for SPF determination.\", \"Polysorbate 80 is one of the key components of protein formulations. It primarily inhibits interfacial damage of the protein molecule due to mechanical stress during shipping and handling. However, polysorbate 80 also affects the formulation photostability. Exposure to light of polysorbate 80 aqueous solution results in peroxide generation, which in turn may result in oxidation of the susceptible amino acid residues in the protein molecule. The purpose of this study was to determine if the photostability of our proprietary IgG(1) monoclonal antibody formulation containing polysorbate 80 is affected by the quality (grade/vendor) of polysorbate 80. Following four types of polysorbate80 were tested: (1) Polysorbate 80 Super-Refined, Mallinckrodt Baker, (2) Polysorbate 80 NF, Mallinckrodt Baker, (3) Polysorbate 80 NF, EMD Chemicals, and (4) Ultra-pure Polysorbate 80 (HX), NOF Corporation. The samples were exposed to light as per ICH guidelines Q1B. The results of the study show that photostability of the antibody formulation is indeed affected by the quality of polysorbate 80. This study underscores the importance of carefully choosing the quality of polysorbate 80 to ensure the robustness of formulation.\", \"Poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s (POD) was a kind of thermally stable fiber. However, its photostability was not good enough in practical application. Although some methods, such as synthetic modification or treatment by using polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane, were used to improve photostability of POD, the procedure was too complicated or costly. In this work, the photostability of POD fiber was improved by adhered iron trihydroxide (Fe(OH)(3)) through coordination bond, which was a relatively simple method. The ferric chloride (FeCl3) was easily adhered to surface of POD fiber by dipping method and then Fe(OH)(3) formed by treatment with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. The existence of Fe(OH)(3) and formation mechanism were proved by XPS, SEM-EDS and FTIR, and the homogeneousness was observed by SEM. Results of XPS and FTIR measurements suggested that the adherence driving force was coordination bond. SEM characterization illustrated that the adherence was quite homogenous. The ability of UV-absorption of Fe(OH)(3), which was confirmed by UV-spectra, could protect poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole) s fiber from photodegradation. The effect of protection was testified by mechanical testing. The results indicated that the Fe(OH)(3) can improve photostability of poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole) s fiber effectively.\", \"Poly(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) fibre has excellent mechanical properties and good thermal stability. However, the use of PBO fibre is limited because of its low photostability. Thus, this work aimed to study the improvement of PBO fibre photostability. Two methods of adhering UV absorbers to PBO fibre surface, namely, coordination bond method and physical adsorption method, were compared. The photo aging results show that the PRO fibres covered by UV absorbers via the coordination bond method were smooth and had no evident particle agglomeration. These fibres showed more improved photostability compared with those covered by UV absorbers via physical adsorption. After 125 h of photo aging, the tensile strength retention rate of PBO fibres covered with UV absorbers via the coordination bond method was still over 90%, which is far higher than that of untreated PBO fibres (approximately 75%).

The concept of photostability is very important in the field of solar protection. The effectiveness of the anti-solar products is quantified using a universal indicator: the sun protection factor (SPF). This number which can be found on packaging can be given in two different ways: by methods in vivo (Colipa method) and in vitro. It is this last method which was adopted for this study. According to selected filter UVB (currently directive 76/768/EEC modified authorized 18 filters UVB), we can obtain more or less effective creams. We chose the irradiation of sun lotions formulated using the authorized filters, used with their maximum amount of employment, in a Suntest, with an irradiance of 650 W/m(2) throughout variable time. With interval of regular time, one carries out a measurement of SPF in order to establish for each filter the kinetics SPF = f/time). An indicator of stability (t(90)) is then given. In this way, we could classify the filters by order of increasing photostability. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Mn porphysomes are as photothermally effective as free-base porphysomes and can rival gadolinium diethylenetriamine-pentaacetate (Gd-DTPA) for MRI contrast generation. Their MRI contrast generation, photothermal efficiency, and photostability are unprecedented for an all-organic nanoparticle composed of a single functional component.\", \"Preparation, characterization, photostability and polarity studies of novel Schiff base dyes using spectroscopic methods were achieved. The Schiff base dyes were prepared by the reaction of salicylalde-hyde/2-hydroxy-l-naphthaldehyde with aminophenazone under microwave irradiation. The spectroscopic (FT-IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, Mass) studies and elemental analyses were in good agreement with chemical structure of synthesized compounds. In addition, UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopic experiments showed that these dyes are good absorbent and fluorescent. Based on the photostability study of these dyes, minimal to no loss in fluorescence intensities of 4-[(2-hydroxy-benzylidene)-amino]1,5-dimemyl-2-phe-nyl-1,2-dihydro-pyrazol-3-one (D1) (6.14%) and 4-[(2-hydroxy-naphthalen-l-ylmethylene)-amino]-1,5-dimethyl-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydro-pyrazol-3-one (D2) (2.95%) was observed with an increase in the exposure time using time-based fluorescence steady-state experiments.

In addition, Dye 2 is found to be more sensitive than Dye 1 to the polarity of the microenvironment provided by different solvents based on the results of fluorescence polarity studies.\", \"The aim of this study was to evaluate the application of quantum dots (QDs) and the FITC labeling technique in Tca8113 cells, and to compare the fluorescence intensity and photostability of these techniques. First, using one-colour confocal microscopy, QDs and FITC were applied separately to tag HSP70 in Tca8113 strains with indirect immunofluorescence. The expression of HSP70 in Tca8113 cells was observed using confocal laser microscopy, and the fluorescence intensity between QDs and FITC was compared. Using two-colour confocal microscopy, QDs and FITC were applied to tag survivin and. HSP70, respectively, in order to compare the fluorescence photostability between QDs and FITC. Using a laser scanning microscope, survivin and HSP70 expression was Clearly detected in the Tca8113 cells. The strength of the fluorescence signal from QDs was higher than that from FITC. After 40 min of continuous laser exposure, there was no observable decline in the QD fluorescent markers, whereas the FITC fluorescent signals faded very quickly and became undetectable. QDs have better fluorescence intensity and photostability than FITC, and are more appropriate for studies that require a long dynamic observation of physiological changes in cells.\", \"The J-aggregate thin film of an oxacyanine dye has been prepared by the spin-coating method on a quartz plate and its photophysical property has been studied. Coherent size of the J-aggregate was estimated to be ca. 4-7 by means of the fluorescence radiative lifetime. Photostability of the J-aggregate thin film and J-aggregate/poly(dimethylsilane) composite thin film has also been examined. Poly(dimethylsilane) vacuum deposited on the J-aggregate thin film was found to markedly enhance the photostability.

It was found that substitution positions affected maximum absorption wavelength, whereas types of substituents, whether hydroxy or alkoxy groups, caused no significant effect. Photostability, however, was affected by both the substitution positions and the types of substituents. An acid-catalyzed mechanism through enolization coupled with pre-organization via hydrogen bonding between two coumarin moieties is proposed as an explanation for the different extents of the [2+2] cycloaddition (dimerization) amongst different derivatives, which results in a different photostability amongst them. Photostable coumarin derivatives with an absorption maximum in the UVA region are reported.\", \"The incorporation of butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMDBM), one of the most efficient and frequently used UV-A blockers, into lipospheres was examined in order to decrease the light-induced sunscreen degradation. Lipospheres, obtained by the melt technique and using tristearin as the lipid material and hydrogenated phosphatidylcholine as the emulsifier, showed proper features in terms of size (1040 mu m), BMDBM loading level (21.63% +/- 0.90%, w/w) and physical state.

To the best of our knowledge, it is the champion efficiency achieved by the random polymer based PSCs which are processed with all non-halogenated solvents. The photostability of the PSCs processed from halogenated solvent and non-halogenated solvent is intensively investigated by using grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) combined with resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) measurement, which is found to be efficient in monitoring the changes of the blend film morphology during irradiation. The results suggest that the crystallinity of the polymer as well as the domain purity of the blends with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) residual decrease dramatically in the illumination condition, due to sensitivity of DIO based device to the illumination. In contrast, the PffBT-2TPF4-9/1:PC61BM based PSCs processed with non-halogenated solvents show much better photostability and high efficiency. Therefore, our study offer an effective method to investigate the photostability of PSCs. It suggests that non-halogenated solvents can be excellent alternatives for large area printing of high-performance PSCs.\", \"The effects of supramolecular encapsulation on the photophysics and photostability of a highly fluorescent dimeric derivative of 2,6-diacetox-y-9,10-bis(arylethynyl)anthracene (G2) were investigated by single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy (SMFS). The fluorescence properties of free-G2 and its self-assembled boronic ester encapsulation complex, G2@(Cap)(2), were compared in solution and a glassy polymer film. The fluorescence spectral characteristics and theoretical calculations suggest that the environment affects the excited-state conformation and subsequent fluorescence emission of G2@(Cap)(2). In particular, in the liquid and polymer environments, G2@(Cap)(2) emits a fluorescence photon in the planar and twist conformation, respectively, whereas the fluorescence-emitting conformation of free-G2 is planar in both environments. The luminous conformation differences between free-G2 and G2@(Cap)(2) in polymer are reflected in the intersystem crossing (ISC) parameters (the ISC quantum yield and triplet lifetime), as determined by fluorescence autocorrelation analysis. The photobleaching yield revealed a 3-fold enhancement in the photostability of encapsulated G2 (relative to free-G2). Under the SMFS measurement conditions, the photostability of the encapsulation complex was independent of the guest's photostability and appeared to be dominated by the thermal stability of the Cap host molecule.\", \"Photostability is an essential property of molecular building blocks of nature. Disulfides are central in the structure determination of proteins, which is in striking contradiction to the result that the S-S bond is a photochemically labile structural entity that cleaves to form free radicals upon light exposure. In an earlier contribution we hypothesized that the key to the photostability of some disulfides may be found in a cyclic structural arrangement. Here we provide further evidence to support this hypothesis by showing that straight chain disulfides undergo ultrafast S-S dissociation on a sub 50 fs timescale without further ado. In a cyclic motif resembling the cysteine-disulfide bond in proteins, light can perturb the S-S bond to generate short-lived diradicaloid species, but the sulfur atoms are conformationally restricted by the ring that prevents the sulfur atoms from flying apart. Conversely, in a straight chain conformation, light perturbation results in two separated RS. radicals because there is no restoring force to counteract the repulsive motion of the sulfur atoms. For the cyclic conformation this restoring force is provided by the cyclic framework, and thus the photostability of disulfide-bonds must be ascribed a cyclic structural arrangement.

The UV-Vis and circular dichroism spectra of these molecules have been simulated using the TDDFT/B3LYP/6-31 +G(d) method. Mulliken atomic charges for each molecule have been compared with Loewdin atomic charges to analyze the molecular charge distribution and phase stability. The highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies corresponding to the electronic transitions in the UV-Vis range have been reported. The excited states have been calculated via configuration interaction singles with semi-empirical Hamiltonian ZINDO (Zerner's intermediate neglect of differential overlap method). Further, the effect of substituent on ultraviolet absorption and photostability of the molecules has been discussed. The photostability of the molecules has been investigated in order to understand the application and operation with ultraviolet and visible light regions.\", \"A series of porous ZnO/SnO2 heterojunction photocatalysts with different Sn contents were successfully synthesized through a simple one-pot solvothermal method. The evolution of particle size, composition, texture structure, and photocatalytic performance as a function of Sn content was systematically studied. It is found that the as-synthesized ZnO/SnO2 heterojunction photocatalysts show much higher photocatalytic activity than ZnO, SnO2, SnxZn1-xO2, and ZnO/Zn2SnO4. Photocorrosion of ZnO was observed, for all samples that contain ZnO nanocrystals, during the photocatalytic process. The photostability of ZnO/SnO2 samples containing small ZnO nanoparticles were significantly enhanced. The most photostable ZnO/SnO2 sample exhibits at least 6.5 times higher photostability than pure ZnO sample. It is proposed that the photocatalytic activities and photostability of the ZnO/SnO2 photocatalysts are determined by the photogenerated carrier transport rates at the SnO2-ZnO and ZnO-electrolyte interfaces.\", \"The photostability of the antihistamine fexofenadine hydrochloride is described. The stress studies revealed the photostability of the drug as the most adverse stability factor. The main photodegradation products were isolated and its structures were elucidated by H-1, C-13, COSY, HSQC, HMBC NMR and mass spectrometry techniques. The drug was exposed to UVC light at 254 nm in methanolic solutions and the degradation was followed by HPLC and TLC. The photostability of fexofenadine tablets was studied and the same degradation products were observed. The two photodegradation products isolated were characterized as the isopropyl derivative, obtained by decarboxilation of fexofenadine, and a benzophenone compound, which was obtained by rearrangement of aromatic rings and oxidation reactions. The results show the importance of appropriate light protection during the drug development process, storage and handling. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The quantum yield of phototransformations was found to depend on the intensity of exciting light; namely, the compounds had higher photostability in more intense excitation fields, This fact was explained by competition between the processes of photoisomerization and stimulated emission.\", \"Photostability is a critical issue for evaluating the use of photocatalysts to realize large-scale implementation of solar energy conversion. Recently emerged ultrasmall gold (Au) clusters with distinctive physicochemical properties have been regarded as visible-light photosensitizers for photoredox catalysis, whereas the poor stability under visible-light exposure greatly restricts their photocatalytic applications. Herein, we provide a proof-of-concept study on enhancing the photostability of ultrasmall Au clusters via a combined strategy of surface engineering and interfacial modification. The photostability of Au clusters on the surface of TiO2 nanosheets with less hydroxyl group can be improved to some extent as compared to that on TiO2 nanoparticles with abundant hydroxyl groups under continuous visible-light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm). Moreover, the subsequent modification of branched polyethylenimine (BPEI) between TiO2 nanosheets and Au clusters further improves their photostability upon light illumination. Consequently, the as-constructed TiO2 nanosheet-BPEI-Au cluster composites exhibit stable visible-light activity toward Cr(VI) photoreduction. It is hoped that the joint strategy via surface engineering and interfacial modification provides a facile guideline for stabilizing ultrasmall Au clusters toward targeting applications in the photoredox catalysis process.\", \"The aim of this study is the improvement of the photostability of several natural anionic dyes, carmine (CM), carthamus yellow (CY), and annatto dye (ANA), by complexation with hydrotalcite. The composite of the dyes and hydrotalcite is prepared by the coprecipitation method. CM is successfully intercalated in the hydrotalcite layer when the amount of introduced CM is large. The photostability of CM in CM/HT composites is superior to the CM adsorbed on silica surface. The effect of the stability enhancement is larger when the amount of introduced CM exceeds 0.23 g/g-host, or when the layer charge density of the hydrotalcite is larger. CY is also stabilized by complexation with hydrotalcite, whereas ANA is not stabilized by complexation with hydrotalcite. The photostability of an anionic natural dye can be improved by intercalation into the hydrotalcite layer, if the dye has a hydrophilic nature and a rather planar structure. The intercalated dye is stabilized by the protection from the attack of the atmospheric oxygen. In addition, contribution of the electrostatic interaction between the positively charged hydrotalcite layer and the intercalated anionic dye is also proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Results have been discussed in terms of the commonly applied pK (a) -based procedure and confronted with a simple approach derived from experimentally-determined correlations reflecting the porphyrins affinity for TFA. Density functional theory (DFT) has proved the porphyrin moiety creates stable diprotonated species involving two TFA molecules, in which the fluorine atoms effectively contribute to the overall interaction of the acid with the porphyrin macrocycle. The relevance of the meso-substituent and ambient medium to the reactivity and photostability of diverse porphyrin derivatives was emphasized and referred to structural features of the investigated diprotonated porphyrins.\", \"Photostability or photo-instability of sunscreen products is most often discussed in undesirable terms with respect to human safety. The health risks, specifically associated with sunscreens, photostable or photo-unstable, include phototoxic/photoirritation or photoallergic responses and, longer-term, an increased risk of skin cancers or photoageing. The aims of this paper are to define photostability/photo-instability and objectively assess the acute and chronic toxicological consequences from the human exposure to UV filter/sunscreens and any probable photo-degradation products. The reported prevalence of photoirritation and photoallergic responses to sunscreens is rare compared with adverse events, for example, skin irritation or sensitization, produced by cosmetics or topically applied drugs and do not directly implicate potential photo-degradation products of UV filters. Moreover, for at least one photo-unstable combination, octyl methoxycinnamate and avobenzone, the long-term benefits to humans, i.e., reduction in skin cancers, seem to outweigh any potential adverse consequences attributed to photo-degradation. Sunscreen products are formulated to achieve maximum efficacy which, by necessity and design, incorporate measures to support and promote photostability since all organic UV filters have the potential to photo-degrade. Current performance measures, in vivo SPF and in vitro UVA, conducted under standardized conditions, in part account for photostability. The concerns expressed when considering human exposure to potential photo-unstable UV filters or sunscreen products may not manifest as health risks under conditions of use. Still, improvement in sunscreen product photostability continues to be a key strategic objective for manufacturers.\", \"All organic fluorophores undergo irreversible photobleaching during prolonged illumination. Although fluorescent proteins typically bleach at a substantially slower rate than many small-molecule dyes, in many cases the lack of sufficient photostability remains an important limiting factor for experiments requiring large numbers of images of single cells. Screening methods focusing solely on brightness or wavelength are highly effective in optimizing both properties, but the absence of selective pressure for photostability in such screens leads to unpredictable photobleaching behavior in the resulting fluorescent proteins. Here we describe an assay for screening libraries of fluorescent proteins for enhanced photostability. With this assay, we developed highly photostable variants of mOrange (a wavelength-shifted monomeric derivative of DsRed from Discosoma sp.) and TagRFP (a monomeric derivative of eqFP578 from Entacmaea quadricolor) that maintain most of the beneficial qualities of the original proteins and perform as reliably as Aequorea victoria GFP derivatives in fusion constructs.\", \"Three laser dyes (perylene orange, perylene red and pyrromethene 567) were dispersed in TEOS-, TEOS/GPTMS-, MTES- and VTES-gel glasses, respectively. The surroundings and fluorescence photostability of the dyes in gel glasses were studied. Due to the formation of a hydrogen bond between the dye and the residual Si-OH attached on the surface of the cages and pores, spectral red shifts of perylene orange at 10 K in TEOS- and TEOS/GPTMS-gel glasses with respect to that in MTES- and VTES-gel glasses were observed. Perylene dyes are more likely to trap in the cages of MTES- and VTES-gel glasses and show high-fluorescence photostability, while ionic and polar pyrromethene 567 tend to appear in the polar pores of gel glasses, which leave pyrromethene 567 vulnerable to photochemical reactions with singlet oxygen and low-fluorescence photostability.

It is found that the mechanism of destruction of the dyes under UV radiation is based on participation of singlet oxygen generated by the excited triplet state of the dye. Singlet oxygen enters the oxidation reactions of the pigment molecules leading to accumulation of colorless products based on di-, monopyrrol, and smaller fragments. Initial stages of the process include the reactions of dehalogenation of the dye molecules and are accompanied by enhancement of the fluorescence of the formed alkyl-substituted dipyrromethenates. The photostability of boron complexes [BF2L] is up to 32 times higher as compared to that of [ZnL2] and [CdL2]. The replacement of 4-iododipyrromethene ligands in [BF2L] and [ML2] by 5,5'-or 4,4'-dibromo-substituted ligands increases photostability of the dyes. The stability of the dyes against UV irradiation substantially decreases in benzene with respect to cyclohexane due to enhancement of polarization of the chromophore systems of dipyrromethene ligands because of their solvation with benzene (pi-pi-stacking).\", \"BB creams appeared on the market quite recently. These creams, which give a perfect complexion by covering up the skin's blemishes, have a photoprotective effect in the majority of cases. An SPF value ranging from 10 to 45 concerning the products we tested is displayed on the packaging. The 21 commercially-available BB creams were tested to assess their efficacy (determination of the SPF) and their photostability (determination of their efficacy after UV irradiation). It was shown that 70% of the products tested have an SPF determined in vitro by us which matches the SPF displayed on the product. For the remaining 30%, it can be seen that products have SPF values of between 2 and 10 times lower than those indicated on the products. It can also be noted that there is a large disparity in terms of photostability since, under the same experimental conditions, however, some products only lose 5% of their photoprotective efficacy, whereas others lose 60%.\", \"Assessment of photochemical stability is essential for evaluating quality and the shelf life of vegetable oils, which are very important aspects of marketing and human health. Most of conventional methods used to investigate oxidative stability requires long time experimental procedures with high consumption of chemical inputs for the preparation or extraction of sample compounds.

An all-numerical routine is employed to solve a complex theoretical problem involving photochemical reaction, thermal lens effect, and mass diffusion during local laser excitation. The photostability of pure oil and oils with natural and synthetic antioxidants is investigated.

Accordingly, binary drug-CD complexes were prepared using the coevaporation method at 1 : 1, 1 : 2, and 1 : 3 stoichiometric ratios, which were characterized by thermal analysis. Subsequently, solutions of the complexes at 500 mu g mL(-1) in HCl 0.1M were subjected to irradiation in a photostability chamber for 12 hours, and the content of the remaining active ingredient was quantified by means of high-performance liquid chromatography. It is possible to observe the presence of two products originating from photodegradation (P1 and P2), which were identified in solutions of loratadine with alpha- and beta-CD. By means of statistical analysis, we conclude that the drug:alpha-CD and drug:gamma-CD (1 : 1) complexes proved to be more efficient in the photostability assay, obtaining a nonsignificant level of degradation and full recovery of LORA.\", \"The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a central role in the regulation of plant development and adaptation to environmental stress.

This compound showed high photostability under UV light exposure, which was 4-fold higher than that of (+/-)-ABA. cis-2,3-cyclopropanated ABA exhibited high ABA-like activity, including the ability to effectively inhibit seed germination, seedling growth and stomatal movements of Arabidopsis. In some cases, its bioactivity approaches that of (+/-)-ABA. trans-2,3-cyclopropanated abscisic acid was also prepared, an isomer that was more photostable but which showed weak ABA-like activity.

Nano zinc oxide (ZnO) has been reported to provide enhanced stability of wood against UV degradation. In this study, the formation of ZnO nanostructures on the surface of solid wood was achieved via a simple two-step process consisting of generation of ZnO seeds on the wood surface followed by a solution treatment to promote crystal growth. The morphology and chemical composition of the ZnO films was studied by field-emission scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray and X-ray diffraction. Accelerated weathering was used to evaluate the photostability of treated wood. The morphology of ZnO nanofilm was dependent on the exposure time in the ZnO seeding solution. Greatly enhanced photostability was achieved with treated wood. UV stability was partially dependent on crystal morphology.

The enhancement may be attributed to the inclusion interaction between HP-beta-CD and doxorubicin. The characterization of FTIR, DSC, XRD and fluorescence titration indicates that 1 : 1 inclusion complex is formed between HP-beta-CD and doxorubicin.\", \"In this letter, the authors investigated the photostability of pentacene organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) with Ta2O5 gate insulators. Under illumination, the threshold voltage shift of the Ta2O5-based OTFTs reached 5.51 V. The obvious photoinstability was attributed to the electron trapping ability of the Ta2O5 film. To solve this problem, poly(4-vinylphenol) (PVP), a type of polymer with low trap density and high photostability was used to modify Ta2O5.

Aqueous solutions of dyes and commercial mouthwashes were submitted to simulated outdoor and indoor conditions of irradiation. All dyes demonstrated high stability in aqueous solutions but discolouration was observed in commercial products after irradiation, highlighting a strong effect of matrix composition on the dyes stability. The photochemical behaviour of dyes corresponded to a first-order reaction.

Formation of multiple hydrogen bonds with, for example, water or alcohols, may lead to enhanced internal conversion; as a result, triplet formation efficiency can be reduced. These changes in photophysical characteristics may influence the photostability. In order to check this hypothesis, we have investigated spectroscopy, photophysics, and changes in photostability caused by interaction with aprotic and protic solvents for 2-(1'H-indol-2'-yl)-[1,5]naphthyridine and 2-(1'H-indol-2'-yl)-[1,8]naphthyridine, molecules with hydrogen bond accepting and donating functionalities. The photostability of these compounds in n-hexane, acetonitrile, and alcohols was studied in the regime of 365 nm irradiation.

However, the intensive pesticide application has triggered several environment negative effects that cannot be disregarded. In this study, the inclusion complex of pyrimethanil with HP-beta-CD has been prepared and characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The formation of the pyrimethanil/HP-beta-CD inclusion complex increased the aqueous solubility of this fungicide around five times. To assess the influence of microencapsulation on the environmental photostability of the fungicide, the photochemical degradation of pyrimethanil and pyrimethanil/HP-beta-CD-inclusion complex has been investigated in different aqueous media such as ultrapure and river water under simulated solar irradiation. The studies allow concluding that pyrimethanil/HP-beta-CD inclusion complex increases significantly the photostability of the fungicide in aqueous solutions, especially in natural water. Actually, the half-life of pyrimethanil/HP-beta-CD inclusion complex was increased approximately by a factor of four when compared to the free fungicide.

UV-vis transmittance spectra showed that poly(vinyl alcohol) PVA/SE film blocked most ultraviolet light below 300 nm even with a low concentration of SE (0.5 wt %), which still kept its high transparency in the visible spectrum. Rhodamine B photo degradation measurement further confirmed the excellent UV-shielding properties of PVA/SE film. FTIR indicated that the carbonyl absorption bands resulting from phtodegradation for PVA/SE film did not change after UV exposure for 2700 h. The tensile properties of neat PVA were deceased intensely after UV irradiation; however, those of PVA/SE film were reduced a little. Moreover, AFM indicated that the surface roughness of PVA/SE film was much lower than that of a neat PVA one. It could be concluded that SE reduced the PVA degradation rate dramatically, revealing enhanced photostability of PVA/SE film. The mechanism for outstanding UV-shielding properties and photostability of PVA/SE film was illuminated, based on the formation of charge transfer complexes (CTCs) between SE and PVA, photothermal conversion, and the well-known radical scavenging capabilities of SE.\", \"This paper reported two nanocomposite sensing platforms for Hg(II) detection with improved photostability, using two rhodamine derivatives as chemosensors and up-conversion nanocrystals as excitation host, respectively. There existed a secondary energy transfer from this excitation host to these chemosensors, which was confirmed by spectral analysis, energy transfer radius calculation and emission decay lifetime comparison. In this case, chemosensor photostability was greatly improved. Further analysis suggested that these chemosensors recognized Hg(II) following a simple binding stoichiometry of 1:1. Hg(II) sensing performance of these sensing platforms was analyzed through their emission spectra upon various Hg( II) concentrations. Emission spectral response, Stem-Volmer equation, emission stability and sensing selectivity were discussed in detail.

In the solid form, after 10 days, pantoprazole concentration was reduced to 27% following zero-order kinetic. The microparticles prepared only with Eudragit S100 (R) demonstrated an increase of the drug photostability. After 10 days of irradiation, 56 and 44%) of the drug was stable when encapsulated by emulsification/ solvent evaporation and spray drying, respectively.

After intercalation, the powder X-ray diffraction pattern showed that the interlayer distance of the LDH increased from 0.90 to 1.54 nm, suggesting that the HSAB anions are arranged in the interlayer galleries of ZnAl-HSAB-LDH as a tilted monolayer of dianions. Infrared spectra and TG-DTA curves revealed the presence of a complex system of supramolecular host-guest interactions between LDH layers and HSAB anions. The thermostability of HSAB and ZnAl-HSAB-LDH was investigated by TG-DTA and UV-vis spectroscopy; it was found that ZnAl-HSAB-LDH was more stable than HSAB at high temperatures. Photostability tests showed that ZnAl-HSAB-LDH exhibited higher stability to UV radiation than either HSAB or a physical mixture of HSAB and ZnAl-NO3-LDH. In their composites with polyethylene, it was also found that ZnAl-HSAB-LDH possesses better thermostability and photostability than HSAB.\", \"Plant polysaccharides have been increasingly employed in the pharmaceutical, industrial, and food environments due to their versatile functional properties. In the present investigation, a heteropolysaccharide galactomannan (GAP) was extracted from Adenanthera pavonina L. seeds and characterized by physicochemical analyses to determine its thermal properties, photostability, antioxidant activity, and acute toxicity. GAP was characterized by FTIR, DSC, and TG. The photostability of GAP submitted to artificial UV irradiation was analyzed. Antioxidant activity was evaluated by the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical-scavenging method, while a bioassay method was carried out to study acute toxicity in Artemia salina L Physical-chemical and functional characteristics of GAP support its potential role in the food and pharmaceutical industries. GAP was photostable under UV irradiation. In vitro GAP antioxidant evaluation showed that it bears free radical-scavenging activity for DPPH radicals. The median lethal concentration (LC50) of GAP was 239.4 mg.mL(-1), indicating that this biopolymer is nontoxic. Such results indicate that this biopolymer presents characteristics of neutrality, photostability, and nontoxicity that are commercially attractive.\", \"A photochromic naphthopyran derivative was embedded in sol-gel prepared thin ormosil films. The resulting samples show high transparency and exhibit a strong red colouration upon irradiation with UV light. The photostability of the photochromic molecules is strongly related to the nature of the embedding ormosil matrix. The introduction of organic functional groups into the inner pore surface of the matrix allows tailoring the chemical environment where the dye molecules will be allocated, in terms of the effectiveness of the interaction between the photochromic molecules and the Si-OH groups on the surface of the pores, affecting the stability of the molecules upon prolonged exposition to UV light.\\nThe photostability of the molecules was increased in matrices functionalized with larger organic groups, or with larger amount of modifying groups. In this way the photodegradation of the photochromic molecules could be reduced by a factor of 5, as compared with the photodegradation of the molecules in unfunctionalized silica matrix.\", \"A simple and rapid on-line analytical system was configured for the evaluation of the photostability of various food coloring agents constantly exposed to light. The screening test for photostability of food coloring agents was carried out in the system consisting of 60 cm of Teflon tubing for ultraviolet (UV) irradiation with a flow rate of mobile phase (water/acetonitrile = 1:1, v/v) at 1 mL/min. When the products derived from photochemical reaction of phloxine (R-104), which is recognized to exhibit chemiluminescence induced by UV irradiation, were separated, several peaks were confirmed on the chromatogram in this system. Furthermore, the peak of chemilumigenics observed on the chromatogram of photon-counting chemiluminescence detection corresponds to the new peaks on the UV chromatogram. Also, the presence of phenoxy radical (g = 2.0061) formed by UV irradiation of R-104 was confirmed with an electron spin resonance spectrometer, indicating a reasonable relationship (r = 0.9041) between the formation of free radical and the chemiluminescence phenomenon.\", \"Gold nanoclusters prepared with a controlled amount of Ag exhibit intense fluorescence with a quantum yield of similar to 16% and a \\\"quasi-monoexponential\\\" long lifetime of >200 ns.

The prepared hybrids were characterized by XRD, FTIR spectroscopy, SEM, TG-DTG-DTA, UV-vis spectroscopy, and CIE 1976 L*a*b* color scales. The results show the successful cointercalation of AB129 and salicylate into the interlayer space of LDHs, forming a new kind of organic-inorganic hybrid pigment, and reveal that intercalation into the interlayer of LDHs can slightly improve the thermal stability of AB129 as a result of the protection offered by LDH layers. The AB129/salicylate molar ratio plays an important part in the color properties of the hybrid pigment. The cointercalation of salicylate can efficiently enhance the photostability of AB129 by absorbing harmful UV rays. Therefore, the cointercalation of AB129 and salicylate into the interlayer of ZnAl LDHs can effectively produce organic-inorganic hybrid pigments with enhanced photostability.\", \"Novel kind of core-shell corona complex micelles were prepared, which enhanced both the hydrolytic stability and the photostability of water-soluble zinc tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin (ZnTPPS) in acidic aqueous solutions. The core-shell gold nanoparticles (AuNPS) were synthesized by reducing HAuCl4 and di-thioester terminated block copolymer, poly(Nisopropylacrylamide)-block-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PNIPAM-b-P4VP). The complex micelles with gold core, P4VP/ZnTPPS shell and PNIPAM corona were formed by simple mixing of gold nanoparticles and ZnTPPS. The photochemical properties of the complex micelles were studied by UV-Visiblespectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results showed trapping of ZnTPPS in the positively charged micellar shell that effectively prevented demetallation of the ZnTPPS that would occur in acidic aqueous solutions. Furthermore, with appropriate concentration of gold nanoparticles, ZnTPPS in the complex micelle had excellent photostability by suppression of generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The enhanced stability of ZnTPPS in acidic aqueous media could be extensively used for photocatalysis and in solar cells.\", \"The antioxidant capacity of cysteine, glutathione, N-acetylcysteine, and ascorbic acid to reduce Methylene Blue to colourless Leucomethylene Blue was analysed.

The particles were spherical, with a rough surface, micrometric (D[4,3] = 9.59 mu m), unimodal and polydisperse (SPAN of 1.12). The final alpha-tocopherol acetate concentration in the powder was 91% of the expected amount. FTIR analyses confirmed that alpha-tocopherol acetate dose not suffer oxidation during the spray drying process. Furthermore, alpha-tocopherol acetate photostability in the microparticles was evaluated for 7 days in a UVC light chamber. The microparticies were capable of maintaining the concentration of alpha-tocopherol acetate for a longer time than a commercially available pulverized form of alpha-tocopherol acetate.

The free-base phthalocyanine and various metal complexes were prepared without discernible degradation of the peripheral electron-withdrawing substituents. Upon irradiation with red light, some of the thus-obtained metal complexes generated high levels of singlet oxygen. In particular, a palladium complex exhibited attractive photostability upon exposure to singlet oxygen as a bleaching agent. The photostability of such complexes that may manifest concomitantly to the generation of high levels of singlet oxygen was attributed to the presence of the electron-withdrawing groups, which results in energetically low-lying highest occupied molecular orbitals.\", \"Photostability measurements were made on host-guest thin films containing nonlinear optical chromophores with an indoline donor and amorphous polycarbonate. We find that the indoline-based chromophores are nearly 10 times more photostable than an analogous compound previously studied and which has a dihydopyridine donor. There is an enhancement of the photostability with increasing chromophore concentration and conjugation length. This can be attributed to a reduction in the average separation between the chromophores and excited state singlet energy transfer to adjacent chromophores followed by eventual nonradiative decay. This leads to a reduction in the singlet oxygen generation rate as the chromophore concentration or conjugation length is increased.\", \"The fluorescence spectra and photostability under 532 nm laser excitation of four different common photoswitches (an azobenzene, spiropyran, indolylfulgide, and a diarylperfluorocyclopentene) were investigated in a silica microstructured optical fibre. An example of each photoswitch was examined in solution and physically adsorbed to the silica fibre surface. This comparison was made to define fluorescence behaviour in these two states and to determine which photoswitch has the best performance in this light intense microenvironment.

The effects of the inclusion behavior of avobenzone with 2-HP-beta-CD were investigated in both solution and the solid state with the following methods: UV-vis spectrophotometry (UV-vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR) and two-dimensional rotational frame nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy (2D ROESY). The photostability of avobenzone and its inclusion complex were both investigated by UV-vis spectrophotometry. The Benesi-Hildebrand's method showed that avobenzone formed 1:2 stoichiometric inclusion complex with 2-HP-beta-CD. The solubility, thermal stability and the photostability of avobenzone were all improved after encapsulating by the 2-HP-beta-CD.

Herein promethazine (PRO), which was chosen as a model drug because of its photodegradation mechanism, was intercalated into this inorganic matrix, and the effects on drug photoprotection were evaluated as well. The hybrid material (MONT-PRO) was successfully prepared with high drug loading and then was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and FTIR spectroscopy. The spectrophotometric measurements as a function of light exposure time showed that PRO intercalation into montmorillonite markedly improved the drug photostability because a 5-fold-slower degradation rate was determined compared to that measured for PRO in homogeneous solutions; nanosecond transient absorption measurements highlighted that the interaction with the inorganic matrix made negligible the photoionization process of the drug, and its efficiency in producing singlet oxygen was strongly reduced.

By using the binding isotherm method and graphical Scatchard plot the sequence of affinity of sensitizers to HSA was obtained: TPPS4>DMHp, Cle(6), Hp, AlPcS(4)>PF. The influence of aggregation on the binding ability of sensitizers is discussed. It was observed that complexation with HSA decreases the photostability of sensitizers. The increased rates of sensitizer photobleaching in the presence of photooxidizable substrates can be explained by the changes of photophysical properties of sensitizers caused by the interaction with substrates or by the attack of the biomolecules photooxidized by the type I mechanism involving electron transfer from excited porphyrin molecule or by the type II mechanism via singlet oxygen on porphyrin microcycle. The sequence of photostability of sensitizers in the presence and in the absence of HSA was established.\", \"We report a facile and general strategy for enhancing the photostability of organic fluorophores for bioimaging applications.

Sunscreens act absorbing or reflecting ultraviolet radiation; in this way, they protect the skin against the damages caused by excessive absorption of ultraviolet radiation. Sunscreens must present photostability, that is the capacity of a product to be retained in skin without degradation by light incidence. The present study aimed to evaluate, through photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) measurements, the photostability of a sunscreen commercially available in Brazil. PAS measurements were performed at 19 Hz, for wavelengths between 270 nm and 400 nm, using a sunscreen with solar protection factor (SPF) 15 applied in skin samples. Photoacoustic spectra of the sunscreen applied to the skin were obtained and analyzed as a function of time after application. Photostability was then evaluated by the comparative study of the integrated areas of the absorption curves for the sunscreen applied to the skin. Results indicate that the sunscreen analyzed was photostable for a large period and was not completely removed by cleaning.\", \"Organic ultraviolet (UV) filters such as cinnamates, benzophenones, p-aminobenzoic derivatives, and avobenzone (which have well-established and recognized UV-filtering efficacies) are employed in cosmetic/pharmaceutical products to minimize the harm caused by exposure of the skin to sunlight.

However, instability is one of the biggest challenges needed to overcome before fulfill their practical applications. To improve their stability, we present a postsynthetic controlled phase transformation of CsPbBr3 toward CsPbBr3/Rb4PbBr6 core/shell structure triggered by rubidium oleate treatment. The resulting core/shell NCs show exceptional photostability both in solution and on-chip. The solution of CsPbBr3/Rb4PbBr6 NCs can remain over 90% of the initial emission photoluminescence quantum yields after 42 h of intense light-emitting diodes illumination (450 nm, 175 mW/cm(2)), which is even better than the conventional CdSe/CdS quantum dots whose emission drop to 50% after 18 h under the same condition. We believe that the exceptional photostability should be resulted from the protection of the robust Rb4PbBr6 shell on CsPbBr3 NCs.\", \"Photostability of phenothiazinyl-substituted ethylenes in both solution and in solid state (thin films) was investigated as a function of UV exposure time. Fluorescence intensity and spectral variation measurements in the presence and absence of ambient air were used to determine the effect of oxygen on the degradation of the compounds. The observed reduction in the fluorescence efficiency of air-saturated solutions and thin films subjected to UV was attributed to permanent photo-oxidative degradation. Photostability was higher in the cases of molecules that contained two bulky phenothiazinyl groups as compared to those containing only one phenothiazinyl group and a smaller phenyl substituent. Fully reversible fluorescence intensity decay in the degassed phenothiazine solutions was attributed to photo-isomerization, whereas the partially reversible changes in fluorescence intensity that were observed for films in the absence of air were ascribed to both photoexcited carrier capture by deep-traps acting as exciton quenching centres and degradation imparted by UV-induced bond scission.

Tretinoin seemed to be most stable in the olive oil cream, followed by the castor oil cream. However microscopic investigation revealed the presence of tretinoin crystals in the olive oil cream, while the other creams were free of it.

We show here that the photostability of a guest molecule can also be significantly improved-without chemical modification-by using physical vapor deposition to pack molecules more densely. Photoisomerization of the substituted azobenzene, 4,4'-diphenyl azobenzene, was studied in a vapor-deposited glass matrix of celecoxib. We directly measure photoisomerization of trans-to cis-states via Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy and show that the rate of photoisomerization depends upon the substrate temperature used during co-deposition of the glass. Photostability correlates reasonably with the density of the glass, where the optimum glass is about tenfold more photostable than the liquid-cooled glass. Molecular simulations, which mimic photoisomerization, also demonstrate that photoreaction of a guest molecule can be suppressed in vapor-deposited glasses. From the simulations, we estimate that the region that is disrupted by a single photoisomerization event encompasses approximately 5 molecules.

The nifedipine content on the surface of the tablet was determined based on the absorbance at 1682 cm(-1) attributable to the C=O stretch vibration in FT-IR-RAS spectra before and after irradiation by fluorescent lamp. The photodegradation followed apparently the first-order kinetics for any sample. The apparent photodegradation rate constant of nifedipine powder increased with decrease of the particle size, while that of its tablet was approximately constant irrespective of particle size.

The resulting water-soluble fluorophores are compact in size (<6 nm) and show similar photostability compared to previously reported crosslinked dendronized polyols (CDPs) and significantly improved photostability compared to the free fluorophores. In contrast to the synthesis of CDPs, the production of LDPs requires less preparation time, synthetic effort, and significantly less Grubbs catalyst. The photophysical properties, including the photostability and emission wavelength of LDPs, can be further fine-tuned by incorporating different combinations of dendronized monomers and fluorophores. Interestingly, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was observed when two different kinds of fluorophores were incorporated into the LDPs.

Unlike the previous reported pentacene-based polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the absorbances of the BDPs were blueshifted by ca. 40 nm relative to pentacene, even after extension of pi-conjugation. The newly synthesized BDP products exhibit relatively good stability with half-lives as high as 4612 min in THF.\", \"Anatase pigment powders were prepared by steplike annealing of the products of ammonium hexafluorotitanate(IV) hydrolysis with Si and Mg additions. Si and Mg have a significant effect on the reflectance of anatase and its changes upon irradiation using a solar simulator and enable control over the pH of aqueous TiO2 suspensions. Increasing the pH of the suspension increases the reflectance and photostability of anatase powders.\", \"The aim of this study was to prepare and characterize tretinoin-loaded nanocapsules as well as to evaluate the influence of this nanoencapsulation on tretinoin photostability. Tretinoin-loaded nanocapsules (0.5 mg ml(-1)) were prepared by interfacial deposition of preformed polymer (poly-epsilon-caprolactone) using two different oily phases: capric/caprylic triglycerides and sunflower seed oil. Tretinoin-loaded nanocapsules presented drug content close to the theoretical value, encapsulation efficiencies higher than 99.9%, nanometric mean size with a polydispersity index below 0.25, and pH values between 5.0 and 7.0. Regarding photodegradation studies, tretinoin methanolic solution showed a half-life time around 40 min according to a first order equation, whereas tretinoin nanocapsule suspensions showed a half-life between 85 and 100 min (twofold higher than in methanolic solution) according to a zero order equation. Tretinoin-loaded nanocapsules improved tretinoin photostability, independently on the type of oily phase used in this study, and represent a potential system to be incorporated in topical or systemic dosage forms containing tretinoin.

The photophysical and electrochemical properties of the complexes were investigated systematically. All iridium complexes exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields, high oxidation potentials and good photostability against continuous irradiation. The optimum loading level of the Ir(III) complexes incorporated into oxygen-sensitive films has been discussed. Three different polymers were investigated for the development of efficient oxygen-sensitive films. All Ir(III) complexes immobilized in ethyl cellulose demonstrated quick responses to various oxygen concentrations and high sensitivity upon changes of oxygen partial pressure. These cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes with high photostability are potential candidates for online continuous monitoring of oxygen concentrations.\", \"Objective: The use of spray-dried powders containing tretinoin-loaded nanocapsules instead of the original liquid suspension, aimed at the preparation of dermatological nanomedicines with improved photostability, was investigated.\\nMethods: Powders were prepared using lactose as a drying adjuvant. Hydrogels were prepared using two approaches: dispersing Carbopol Ultrez 10 (R) in an aqueous redispersion of the powder or incorporating the powder in previously formed hydrogels.\\nResults and discussion: The photodegradation of tretinoin in hydrogels prepared with the powders showed similar half-life times (around 19.5 h) compared to preparations with the original liquid nanocapsules (20.7 +/- 1.4 h), regardless of the preparation approach. In addition, the topical nanomedicines prepared with the spray-dried powders presented a significant improvement in tretinoin photostability compared to the formulation containing the non-encapsulated drug.\\nConclusion: This study verified that the addition of the spray-dried powders containing tretinoin-loaded lipid-core nanocapsules to hydrogels did not influence the photoprotection of the drug compared with the preparation procedure using the original liquid suspension.\", \"The nanoporous TiO2 film electrodes have been prepared by a sol-gel deposition process. The photostability of the electrodes at different pH values have been studied. The results show that the photostability of the electrodes decreases with increasing solution pH, especially in strong basic solutions without methanol. The increase of photocurrent and the decrease of onset potential with solution pH can be attributed to the increase of the adsorbed HO- ions. The adsorbed HO- ions act not only as electron donors but as also potential-determining ions on TiO2 film surface. However, in basic solutions the adsorbed O2- anions on TiO2 surface will form as pH value increases. The reaction of holes to the adsorbed O2- anions produces active O- anions. In the solutions without enough methanol the products of active O- anions oxidize Ti3+ to Ti4+ on TiO2 film surface and subsurface to occupy gradually the oxygen vacancies as electron donors. This results in the nanoporous TiO2, film electrodes being unstable with increasing pH. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, its formulation into solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) has attracted increasing attention as a potential drug-delivery carrier. Two HYP-loaded SLNs formulations were prepared utilizing microemulsion-based technique. Thereafter, the physicochemical properties of the formulations were investigated and evaluated. HYP-loaded SLNs showed spherical shape with mean particle size ranging from 200-300 nm for both formulations (FA and FB). The encapsulation efficiencies reached above 80% and FA showed significant higher encapsulation than FB (P < 0.05), also, the thermal analysis using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated good compatibility between hypericin and lipids forming the cores in both formulations. Spectroscopic measurements of the photostability study showed that hypericin encapsulation into SLNs improved its photostability, compared to free HYP in 0.1% ethanolic solution. However, photocytotoxicity studies on HepG2 cells revealed an evident inhibition of the photodynamic efficacy of HYP-loaded SLNs, compared to free HYP. In conclusion, although the elevated entrapment efficiency of HYP into SLNs increased its photostability, it decreased its phototoxicity which might be due to the quenching deactivation of HYP molecules resulting from SLN compactness and thickness structure.\", \"The effect of UV-irradiation on four different types of native starch (corn, waxy corn, wheat and potato) have been investigated. Although the changes in the chemical structure of starch specimens were small, indicating good photostability, the samples lost adsorbed water and their crystallinity degree decreased after irradiation. Moreover, a drop in average molecular weight occurred in samples (with the exception of potato starch) as a result of main chain scission. The variations in the properties of investigated specimens of various origin were related to the differences in their structure and macromolecular arrangement. The lowest photostability among the four starches was exhibited by potato starch. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

By acquiring just two time-resolved photoacoustic signals, one in the sample of interest and the other in water, measurements of the thermalisation efficiency and other parameters relevant to the characterization of contrast agents can be acquired. The method was validated using absorbing solutions of known thermalisation efficiency and Gruneisen coefficient.

However, conventional fluorescent reagents for mitochondrial imaging usually suffer from poor photostability and poor solubility in water as well as complex molecular structure and multi-step synthesis. Therefore, the development of an efficient method to construct specifically mitochondria-targeted molecules with superior photostability and aqueous solubility is in high demand for the study of mitochondrial functions. In this manuscript, a new type of aqueous-soluble fluorescent probe based on the perylene skeleton has been developed efficiently and exhibits high specificity to mitochondria with dual-emissive luminescence in living cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a dual-emissive probe for specific mitochondrial imaging. Moreover, this perylene-based probe also exhibits superior photostability. The dual-emissive imaging, high specificity, and superior photostability as well as the efficient preparation make this perylene-based phosphonium fluorophore highly attractive as a fluorescent probe for mitochondrial imaging.\", \"In this study, we attempt to simultaneously improve the photostability and solubility of epalrestat (a drug used for neuropathy treatment) by preparing epalrestat betaine zwitterionic cocrystals and characterize the physicochemical property alterations accompanying their formation. Notably, we reveal that the strong hydrogen bonds between epalrestat and betaine molecules in the above cocrystals and the reduced size of the reaction cavity around epalrestat molecules prevent the E,Z to Z,Z photoisomerization of the latter, resulting in improved photostability. Furthermore, the prepared cocrystals exhibit a higher solubility and larger dissolution rate than pure epalrestat crystals due to featuring a layered structure with alternately arranged epalrestat and betaine coformer molecules.\", \"The naphthopyran (NP) derivative (3-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran) exhibits photochromism in solution or embedded in solid matrices. The molecule suffers a progressive photodegradation upon prolonged irradiation with UV-light, which depends strongly on the solvent or the embedding matrix. The photodegradation of the dye molecules in THF or benzene solutions is much faster than that of the molecules embedded in solid matrices (polymer or ormosil). The organic functional groups incorporated in the network of the ormosil matrix play an important role in the photostability of the dye, as they determine the chemical environment of the dye molecules in the matrix. In this way, the dye embedded in matrices whose inner pore surface is functionalized with phenyl groups exhibits a photostability nine times higher than in unmodified matrices, being their degradation half-life (t(1/2(deg)) 181 h and 21 h, respectively. The photostability of the photochromic dye in the ormosil matrices was also measured as a function of the dye loading, showing higher stability as the amount of dye is increased. The photostability of the dye in photochromic materials is an important issue in sight of the possible applications of these materials, as the performance of the devices involves repeated exposure to UV radiation.

With the addition of surfactants, the aggregations of polymers are broken up. For eliminating the self-quenching effect of the fluorescent polymers, the photoluminescence of PPESO3 is dramatically enhanced. The photoluminescence of PPESO3 can be enhanced 6- to 12-fold with the addition of different surfactants, and at higher concentration of surfactants, the photostability of PPESO3 is also highly increased. A \\\"micelle incorporation model\\\" is proposed to explain the enhancement of photostability. To deeply understand the interaction processes between PPESO3 and surfactants, we systematically studied the fluorescence spectra changes of PPESO3 and the dynamic processes at different CTAB concentrations.

The photostability and retention of the molecules in the films depend strongly on parameters such as the composition of the hybrid host matrix, the UV-absorber loading in the matrix and the sol-gel preparation conditions. The amount of the modifying phenyl group was found to affect strongly the retention of the UV absorber molecules in the matrix. The retention of the molecules incorporated in the thin-films showed an increase of 21 times as the amount of the phenyl groups is reduced by a factor of 4. On the other hand, the incorporation of increasing amounts of Ph groups lead to a slight decrease of the photostability of the UV absorber molecules. The ability to control the parameters affecting the durability of the UV absorber molecules in the sol-gel matrices allows us increase the effectiveness of the UV-protective films and hence their potential usage in both, indoors and outdoors applications.\", \"Ultraviolet irradiation of DNA produces electronic excited states that predominantly eliminate the excitation energy by returning to the ground state (photostability) or following minor pathways into mutagenic photoproducts (photodamage). The cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) formed from photo-dimerization of thymines in DNA is the most common form of photodamage. The underlying molecular processes governing photostability and photodamage of thymine-constituted DNA remain unclear. Here, a combined femtosecond broadband time-resolved fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopies were employed to study a monomer thymidine and a single-stranded thymine oligonuclectide. We show that the protecting deactivation of a thymine multimer is due to an ultrafast single-base localized stepwise mechanism where the initial excited state decays via a doorway state to the ground state or proceeds via the doorway state to a triplet state identified as a major precursor for CPD photodamage.

The formation of hydrogen bonds with alcohols leads to a significant decrease of the triplet formation efficiency and an increase of photostability. The photodegradation yield was found to be about two hundred times lower in methanol and 1-propanol than in n-hexane or acetonitrile. A similar effect has been reported for two indole-naphthyridines, molecules that can exist in syn and anti rotameric forms. We demonstrate that IA, which can exist only in the syn form, is more photostable in alcohols than similar, but non-rigid molecules. This additional photostability enhancement is due to the elimination of a slower channel of excited state deactivation in alcohol complexes, S0 ' S1 internal conversion. The dominant, faster channel of S1 depopulation is the excited state double proton transfer, manifested by the presence of low energy tautomeric fluorescence.\", \"In this work, we used monolayer graphene, either underneath or on top of the R6G molecules, to enhance the stability and reproducibility of surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The time evolution of characteristic peaks of the organic molecules was monitored using Raman spectroscopy under continuous light irradiation to quantitatively characterize the photostability. Graphene underneath the organic molecules inhibits the substrate-induced fluctuations; and graphene on top of the organic molecules encapsulates and isolates them from ambient oxygen, greatly enhancing the photostability.

We have synthesized two curcumin complexes, the first a boron curcumin complex (B-Curl) and the second an iron (Fe-Cur(3)) complex of curcumin. Both derivatives showed high fluorescence efficiency (quantum yield) and greater photostability in solution. The improved photostability could be attributed to the coordination structures and the removal of beta-diketone group from curcumin.\\nThe fluorescence and ultra violet/visible absorption spectra of curcumin, B-Cur(2) and Fe-Cur(3) all have a similar spectral pattern when dissolved in the same organic solvent. However, a shift towards a lower wavelength was observed when moving from polar to non-polar solvents, possibly due to differences in solvent polarity. A plot of Stokes' shift vs the orientation polarity parameter (Af) or vs the solvent polarity parameter (E-T 30) showed an improved correlation between the solvent polarity parameter than with the orientation polarity parameter and indicating that the red shift observed could be due to hydrogen-bonding between the solvent molecules. A similar association was obtained when Stokes' shift was replaced by maximum synchronous fluorescence.

As the fluorescence lifetime of the nanocrystals is monitored, we find it increases with time from 6 to 18 ns and then saturates. Placing the nanocrystals in a polymer matrix remarkably improves the photostability and all the above-mentioned effects are diminished.

Both formulations were supplemented with bemotrizinol. Photostability was evaluated by exposing, or not, formulations spread on a glass plate to UVA/UVB irradiation. The resulting products were quantified by HPLC analysis. In vitro phototoxicity of UV-filters and combinations were evaluated using 3T3 viable monolayer fibroblast cultures submitted, or not, to irradiation according to OECD TG 432.

Some NIR cyanine dyes such as IR820 have achieved great success in energy harvesting and cancer therapy. However, their action is limited for low photostability, considerable thermal degradation, short circulation times, and nonspecific biodistribution. Our present study is an attempt to overcome such limitations by attaching a model cyanine dye IR820 with ZnO nanoparticles. We prepared an IR820-ZnO nanohybrid and characterized it using microscopic and optical spectroscopic tools. Thermogravimetric analysis depicted greater thermal stability of the IR820-ZnO nanohybrid compared to free dye. We explored the enhancement in the photostability of IR820 upon nanohybrid formation. We detected generation of photoinduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide, singlet oxygen, and so forth using appropriate molecular probes. The formation of IR820-ZnO nanohybrid reduced production of photoinduced singlet oxygen. However, it revealed an alternative trend in overall ROS formation (increases total ROS) under red light illumination. To correlate the enhanced photostability of IR820 on the ZnO surface, we explored excited-state dynamical processes at the interface in nanohybrids. We illustrated the photoinduced excited-state electron-transfer process from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of IR820 to the conduction band of ZnO. This photoelectron-transfer process enhances the production of ROS and decreases the formation of singlet oxygen that altogether leads to improvement in photostability and overall activity. A quencher of singlet oxygen sodium azide (NaN3) was used to further confirm the direct association of singlet oxygen generation with the photostability issue of IR820. Also, ZnO is able to deliver the dye selectively in acidic environment, which suggests its diseased site-specific targeted activity.

Owing to high photostability from the combination of inner independent luminescence center and thick shell (>= 15 monolayers (MLs)), inner-Mn-doped core/giant-shell QDs with bright wide emission are a promising candidate for QD lighting. Aiming at bright and high-photostable giant QDs with low time cost (giant-shell growth time: within 20 min), we put forward the perfect combination strategy of hot-injection nucleation doping and optimized \\\"flash\\\" synthesis, going beyond the combination strategy of one-pot growth doping and typical \\\"flash\\\" synthesis, which led to an increase in photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) of giant Mn-doped CdS/ZnS QDs, (ZnS shell: similar to 18 MLs) from <= 20% to 40%. The PLQY was enhanced to 45% by light annealing. Using traditional LED as the reference, these simply-encapsulated QDs can exhibit the high photostability, throwing light of the application of these inner-Mn-doped core/giant-shell QDs even for QD lighting.

The morphology and chemical composition of the formed coatings were examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and Fourier transform IR spectroscopy. Water contact angle (WCA) was used to characterize hydrophobicity. UV-Vis spectroscopy and accelerated weathering were used to evaluate the UV-shielding properties of the nanocoatings and the photostability of the treated wood, respectively. The results showed that the introduction of TiO2 nanoparticles facilitated the generation of a dual-size roughness on the wood substrate, and the long-chain alkyl groups of HDTMS were covalently linked to the surface of the particles. The WCA of the treated wood was improved remarkably up to approximate to 138 degrees displaying high hydrophobicity. The TiO2 coatings also exhibited strong absorption of UV radiation and imparted the underlying wood substrate with enhanced photostability, which was highly dependent on the TiO2 loadings in the coatings.\", \"Pentacene derivatives possessing nitronyl nitroxide radical substituents (1a and 1b) were synthesized, and their photochemical properties were evaluated. 1a with two radical substituents showed a remarkable enhancement of photostability compared with pentacene, 6,13-bis-(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene and the monoradical, 1b. This is understood due to the presence of the multiple deactivation pathways in the photoexcited states.\", \"A N-annulated perylene unit was successfully fused to the meso- and beta-positions of a boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) core. The newly synthesized BODIPY dye 1b exhibits intensified near-Infrared (NIR) absorption and the longest emission maximum ever observed for all BODIPY derivatives. In addition, this dye possesses excellent solubility and photostability, beneficial to practical applications.\", \"The lasing properties of rhodamine 6G dissolved in poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) matrices with different amounts of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as crosslinking monomer are investigated. Increasing the rigidity of the matrix by decreasing the polymer free volume results in significant increases of both lasing efficiency and photostability. There exists an optimum degree of crosslinking for which efficiency and photostability reach the highest values.\", \"Application of protein encapsulation silica materials requires biomolecules to maintain stabilization on potentially adverse industrial conditions. The C-phycocyanin (C-PC) is chosen as a probe to monitor influence of the protein encapsulation process and to study protein and matrix interaction and stability of protein in silica matrix. Both C-PCs in solution and in silicate matrix irradiated by ultraviolet rays can result in photodestruction, whereas the protein in the silica is less affected. The measured photodamage rate constant of C-PC in silica is 25 times slower than that of C-PC in buffer solution. However, lifetimes of C-phycocyanin in phosphate buffer and silica matrix are identical. These studies suggest that entrapment of C-PCs into silica matrixes not only can keep their biological activity and obviously also improve their photostability.\", \"Photostability and physicochemical properties of nicardipine hydrochloride polymorphs (alpha- and beta-form) were studied by using Fourier-transformed reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR-RAS) of the tablets, X-ray powder diffraction analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and color difference measurement. It was clear from the results of FT-IR-RAS spectra after irradiation that nicardipine hydrochloride in the solid state decomposed to its pyridine derivative when exposed to light. The photostability of the ground samples of two forms was also measured in the same manner. The two crystalline forms of the drug changed to nearly amorphous form after 150 min grinding in a mixer mill. X-ray powder diffraction patterns of those ground samples showed almost halo patterns. The nicardipine hydrochloride content on the surface of the tablet was determined based on the absorbance at 1700 cm(-1) attributable to the C=O stretch vibration in FT-IR-RAS spectra before and after irradiation by fluorescent lamp (3500 Ix). The photodegraclation followed apparently the first-order kinetics for any sample. The apparent photodegradation rate constant of beta-form was greater than that of alpha-form. The ground samples decomposed rapidly under the same light irradiation as compared with the intact crystalline forms. The photodegradation rate constant decreased with increase of the heat of fusion.

The relative position of the IMHB in the naphthalene skeleton acts as a switch and controls the yield of an excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. As a matter of fact, only MHN23 exhibits a proton transfer (PT) emission and possesses a theoretically proved ESIPT mechanism. The role that the ESIPT mechanism plays on the photostability of the molecule MHN23 is unravelled by comparison with the model compounds methyl salicylate (MS), MHN12, and MHN21. On one hand, the low photoreaction quantum yield, Phi(r) = 0.00015, and therefore the high photostability of MS, under direct ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, has been explained due to the photophysics of its proton transfer tautomer. On the other hand, (a) the two benzene-fused ring derivatives of methyl salicylate, MHN12 and MHN21, also possess a great photostability to UV radiation, and they do not support an ESIPT mechanism; and (b) although MHN23 exhibits an excited state proton transfer, its efficiency is only of 1.8%, and the photostability is 5 times larger than that of MS. As a result, the photostability of MHN23, MHN12, and MHN21 does not rely on the photophysics of their proton transfer tautomers but on the nonradiative dynamics of their respective normal tautomers. We present experimental evidence which supports the above-mentioned statement on the existence of distinctive nonradiative channels for the molecules MHN23, MHN12, and MHN21.\", \"Doxycycline hyclate (DOX) is a highly photosensitive drug, a feature that limits the stability of the corresponding dosage forms. The main objectives of this work were the preparation and characterization of an inclusion complex of DOX with beta-cyclodextrin (beta CD) and to investigate if this approach could improve the photostability of the drug. Guest-host interactions were investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance, which were afterwards combined with molecular modeling methods to study the complex formation and its three-dimensional structure was proposed. A freeze-drying method was applied to obtain the complex in the solid state, which was further confirmed by thermal and spectroscopic techniques. To evaluate the complexation effect on DOX integrity, the photostability of the inclusion complex was studied, with a significant decrease in the photodegradation of DOX being found in aqueous solution upon complexation. Finally, the photoprotection produced by the complexation was evaluated by means of an antimicrobial assay. Overall, the presented results suggest that the formulation of DOX complexed with beta CD constitutes an interesting approach for the preparation of pharmaceutical dosage forms of DOX with enhanced stability properties.\", \"Screening for photostability in addition to color and brightness creates better fluorescent proteins.\", \"The phenolic hydroxyl groups in the lignin model compounds, 2-methoxy-4-propylphenol and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyacetophenone, were removed by first converting the hydroxyl groups to the trifluoromethanesulfonates (triflates) and then cleaving the triflate substituents via catalytic hydrogen transfer. The products, 1-methoxy-3-propylbenzene and 3-methoxyacelophenone: were characterized by H-1 and C-13 NMR, mass spectrometry and elemental analyses. The effect of the removal of the phenolic groups on the photostability of the model compounds was evaluated by impregnating the compounds into Whatman filter paper sheets, and subjecting them to an accelerated yellowing experiment in a UV chamber. The removal of the phenolic groups resulted in a significant yellowing inhibition, with a higher photostabilizing effect than methylation or acetylation of the hydroxyl, particularly for the model compound without an alpha-carbonyl group.\", \"Organic-inorganic hybrid pigments with enhanced thermo- and photostability have been prepared by co-intercalating C.I. Acid Red 337 (AR337) and a UV absorbent (BP-4) into the interlayer of ZnAl layered double hydroxides through a coprecipitation method. The obtained compounds were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric-differential thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis, UV-visible spectroscopy, and the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) 1976 L*a*b* color scales. The results show the successful co-intercalation of AR337 and BP-4 into the interlayer region of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and reveal the presence of host-guest interactions between LDH host layers and guest anions of AR337 and BP-4 and guest-guest interactions between AR337 and BP-4. The intercalation can improve the thermostability of AR337 due to the protection of LDH layers. Moreover, the co-intercalation of AR337 and BP-4 not only markedly enhances the photostability of AR337 but also significantly influences the color of the hybrid pigment.\", \"The boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dye containing an annelated cyclohexyl rings at the 2,3 and 5,6-positions of pyrroles has been synthesized and characterized. Photochemical properties of the obtained compound have been investigated in different individual solvents. 2,3;5,6-Bis(cyclohexano)-BODIPY exhibits intense chromophore properties with maximum of S (o) -> S (1) band in the 543-549 nm (A from 66000 to 96000 L/mol center dot cm). The complex is a fluorophore with a quantum yield up to similar to 100%. The influence of solvent polarity on the spectral properties was evaluated. To better understand the spectroscopic results, quantum chemical calculations were carried out. Photostability of dye was studied.\", \"Ultraviolet light photostability of thin dichroic crystalline films made of water-soluble dyes has been studied using two radiation sources, an Ar-ion laser operating at wavelength 352 nm and a powerful mercury lamp. Three dyes, Violet, Blue and Red perspective for application as sheet polarizers, were chosen. Blue dye has shown good UV stability, for the Violet dye the optical absorbance has markedly decreased due to film bleaching, for the Red dye an unexpected increase of absorbance was observed.\", \"Based on the principle that chlorophyll's photodegradation occurs in the presence of oxygen, high-oxygen-barrier polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) films comprising chlorophyll are prepared without photodegradation of chlorophyll by a facile procedure. The photostability of the films are characterized by the absorption spectra. The result shows that the chlorophyll in the films can keep photostable at least for six months whereas the photostability of chlorophyll in ethanol is less than one day. The absorption maxima of chlorophyll/PVA films at red band, which are at 668nm due to the chlorophyll and consist with that of chlorophyll in ethanol (666 nm), shift blue after the sunlight treatment. The shift extent increases with the time of sunlight treatment and decreases with the content of chlorophyll in samples. The method proposed in the study could greatly improve the photostability of chlorophyll and can be used in the field of photocatalysis.\", \"Layered halide perovskites have recently shown extraordinary potential for low-cost solution-processable optoelectronic applications because of their superior moisture stability over their 3D counterparts. However, few studies have investigated the effect of light on layered hybrid perovskites. Here, the mechanically exfoliated nanoflakes of the 2D perovskite (PEA)(2)PbI4 (PEA, 2-phenylethylammonium) are used as a model to investigate their intrinsic photostability. The light-induced degradation of the flakes is investigated by using in situ techniques including confocal laser scanning microscopy, wide-field fluorescence microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Under resonant photoexcitation, (PEA)(2)PbI4 degrades to PbI2. It is clearly shown that this process is initiated at the crystal edges and from the surface. As a consequence, the photoluminescence of (PEA)(2)PbI4 is progressively quenched by surface traps. Importantly, the light-induced degradation can be suppressed by encapsulation using hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flakes and/or polycarbonates. This report sheds light on a specific mechanism of light-induced degradation in layered perovskites and proposes a new encapsulation method to improve their photostability.\", \"Photostability of liquid-crystal (LC) materials and surface alignment layers was evaluated using a UV lamp and a blue laser beam. Both organic polyimide (PI) and inorganic silicon-dioxide (SiO2) alignment layers were studied under nitrogen environment. Two commercial TFT-grade LC mixtures (low-birefringence MLC-9200-000 and high-birefringence TL-216) were used for comparisons. Results indicate that SiO2 alignment layers are much more robust than PI layers, and low birefringence LCs are more stable than the high-birefringence ones. At the He-Cd laser wavelength (gimel = 442 nm), both LC mixtures and SiO2 alignment layers are hardly damaged. To lengthen the lifetime of an LCD projector, inorganic SiO2 alignment layers, high-optical-density UV filter, long cutoff-wavelength blue filter, and short-conjugation (low birefringence) LC materials should be considered.\", \"Y2O3:Bi3+,Eu3+ nanosheets are produced by calcinating hydrothermally synthesized precursor nanosheets. Transmission electron microscope observation confirms that the sheet-like morphology remains unchanged after calcination at either 600 or 800 degrees C for 2 h. The excitation spectrum monitored at 612 nm emission corresponding to the D-5(0)-> F-7(2) transition of Eu3+ has a broad band at 331 nm that is attributed to the 6s(2)-> 6s6p transition of Bi3+. The Y2O3:Bi3+,Eu3+ nanosheets therefore exhibit the red emission of Eu3+ through energy transfer from Bi3+ to Eu3+ following excitation of Bi3+. The photostability of Y2O3:Bi3+,Eu3+ nanosheets is evaluated from their change in photoluminescence intensity during continuous excitation. The photoluminescence intensity of Y2O3:Bi3+,Eu3+ nanosheets decreases to more than 90% of the initial intensity soon after irradiation begins, and then the photoluminescence intensity gradually recovers. In contrast, the photoluminescence intensity of YVO4:Bi3+,Eu3+ nanoparticles decreases to 53.6% of the initial intensity during excitation. These results indicate that Y2O3:Bi3+,Eu3+ nanosheets have higher photostability than YVO4:Bi3+,Eu3+ nanoparticles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The main purpose of the study was to enhance the stability of beta-lapachone using the microencapsulation method. The Shirasu porous glass membrane was used to achieve uniform-sized microcapsules. The prepared microcapsules were evaluated to investigate how process parameters affect the encapsulation efficiency, photostability and particle size distribution. The experimental design was conducted to obtain optimal formulations. In addition, an operating space was drawn to identify the safer range of control factors. All control factors showed significant effects on the encapsulation efficiency and photostability. For example, when a large amount of polymers was used, encapsulation efficiency and photostability were improved. However, as the amount of polymers increased, large and polydisperse microcapsules were produced. The robust design method provided information to characterise significant factors, thereby allowing effective control of photostability and size of microcapsules.\", \"Seven compounds, all derivatives of benzanthrone, five of them containing an unsaturated group, have been synthesized. They were characterized by elemental analysis, UV/Vis and H-NMR spectra. Their spectroscopic characteristics, such as fluorescence and phosphorescence, have been studied, and the photostability of two of them assessed. Coloured polystyrene has been synthesized in the presence of the dyes and the influence of the dye on the photostability of the coloured polymers established.\", \"Simply by elevating the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction temperature for ZnS deposition, we successfully demonstrated improved photostability of PbS-based quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) which was credited to efficient surface coverage of ZnS over PbS QDs and TiO2. Using open-circuit voltage decay and cyclic voltammetry techniques distinctly, it was affirmed that the back electron transfer at TiO2/PbS/electrolyte interface was reduced. Superior deposition of ZnS in terms of surface coverage not only exhibited increase in photocurrent density (from 20.7 mA/cm(2) to 22.3 mA/cm(2)) and power conversion efficiency (from 3.1% to 3.4%), it also stabilized the normalized current significantly.\", \"The use of insect repellents either indoors or at places with incidence of solar radiation has been common due to dengue epidemics in Brazil. The lack of studies on the photostability of these substances has motivated this study, where the main goal was to verify the photostability and photodegradation of some of the commercially insect repellents available under the simulated ultraviolet (UV) radiation, by evaluating the molecular changes using dispersive Raman spectroscopy (830 nm excitation). A laboratory-made chamber was used for irradiating the repellents, where UV-A + UV-B radiations (UV-A: 5.5 mW/cm(2) and UV-B 1.5 mW/cm(2)) can be obtained. The chamber internal temperature did not exceed 31 degrees C during experiments. The compounds n, n-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), IR-3535, andiroba and citronella oils, used as active ingredients in insect repellents, and commercial formula containing DEET (14.5% in ethanol and isopropyl myristate) and IR-3535 (16% in carbopol) were continuously irradiated for 8 h. The Raman spectrum of each sample was obtained before and after UV exposure. The compounds and the commercial formula containing IR-3535 showed photo-stability when irradiated, since no changes in the peaks were found. The commercial formula containing DEET showed spectral decrease at 524, 690, 1003 and 1606 cm(-1), assigned to the DEET, and increase at 884 cm(-1), assigned to the ethanol. These results indicate that the excipient could influence the photostability of the active ingredient. The Raman spectroscopy can be suitable to monitor the photodegradation under UV irradiation rapidly and reliably.\", \"An organic UV absorber has been intercalated into a layered double hydroxide (LDH) host by ion-exchange method using ZnAl-NO3-LDH as a precursor with an aqueous solution of the sodium salt of 5-benzotriazolyl-4-hydroxy-3-sec-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (BZO). After intercalation of the UV absorber, the interlayer distance in the LDHs increases from 0.89 to 2.32 nm. Infrared spectra and thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) curves reveal the presence of a complex system of supramolecular host-guest interactions. The thermostability of BZO is markedly enhanced by intercalation in the LDH host. ZnAl-BZO-LDHs/polypropylene composite materials exhibit excellent UV photostability. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

However monodispersity, high and consistent photoluminescence, photostability, and biocompatibility are still major challenges. This work focuses on optimizing the photophysical properties and biocompatibility of QDs by forming core-shell nanostructures and their encapsulation by a carrier. Highly luminescent CdS and CdS-ZnS core-shell QDs with 5 nm sizes were synthesized using a facile approach based on pyrolysis of the single molecule precursors. After capping the CdS QDs with a thin layer of ZnS to reduce toxicity, the photoluminescence and photostability of the core-shell QDs was significantly enhanced. To make both the bare and core/shell structure QDs more resistant against photochemical reactions, a mesoporous silica layer was grown on the QDs through a reverse microemulsion technique based on hydrophobic interaction. This encapsulation enhanced the quantum yield and photostability compared to the bare QDs by providing much stronger resistance to oxidation and Oswald ripening of QDs. Encapsulation also improved biocompatibility of QDs that was evaluated with human umbilical vein endothelial cell lines (HUVEC).\", \"Bright, long-lasting and non-phototoxic organic fluorophores are essential to the continued advancement of biological imaging. Traditional approaches towards achieving photostability, such as the removal of molecular oxygen and the use of small-molecule additives in solution, suffer from potentially toxic side effects, particularly in the context of living cells. The direct conjugation of small-molecule triplet state quenchers, such as cyclooctatetraene (COT), to organic fluorophores has the potential to bypass these issues by restoring reactive fluorophore triplet states to the ground state through intra-molecular triplet energy transfer. Such methods have enabled marked improvement in cyanine fluorophore photostability spanning the visible spectrum. However, the generality of this strategy to chemically and structurally diverse fluorophore species has yet to be examined. Here, we show that the proximal linkage of COT increases the photon yield of a diverse range of organic fluorophores widely used in biological imaging applications, demonstrating that the intra-molecular triplet energy transfer mechanism is a potentially general approach for improving organic fluorophore performance and photostability.\", \"Arylvinylenebipyridyl (AVE) ligands are bright, zinc(II)-sensitive fluotoionophores. The applicability of AVBs as fluorescent indicators for imaging cellular zinc(II), however, is limited by 'low photostability, partially atttibutal?le to the photoisomerization of the vinylene functionality. Two configurationally immobilized (ice., \\\"locked\\\") AVE analogues are prepared in this work. The zinc(II)-sensitive photophysical properties and zinc(II) affinities of both AVBs and their locked analogues are characterized in organic and aqueous media. The zinc(II) sensitivity of the emission is attributed to the zinc(II)dependent energies of the charge transfer excited states of these compounds. The configurationally locked ligands have improved photostalpility, while maintaining the brightness and zinc(II) sensibility of their AVB progenitors. The feasibility of the \\\"locked\\\" AVE analogues with improved photostability for imaging intracellular Zn(II) of eukaryotic cells using laser confocal fluorescence microscopy is demonstrated.\", \"Here we report that photostability and photoactivity of WO3 for water oxidation can be simultaneously enhanced by controlled introduction of oxygen vacancies into WO3 in hydrogen atmosphere at elevated temperatures. In comparison to pristine WO3, the hydrogen-treated WO3 nanoflakes show an order of magnitude enhanced photocurrent, and more importantly, exhibit extraordinary stability for water oxidation without loss of photoactivity for at least seven hours. The enhanced photostability is attributed to the formation of substoichiometric WO3-x after hydrogen treatment, which is highly resistive to the re-oxidation and peroxo-species induced dissolution. This work constitutes the first example where WO3 can be stabilized for water oxidation in neutral medium without the need for oxygen evolution catalysts. The demonstration of electrochemically stable WO3 could open up new opportunities for WO3 based photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic applications.\", \"The quest for a solid-state tunable dye laser can be satisfied by sol-gel prepared organic-inorganic hybrids. A photostability study of porous silica-Rhodamine 6G hybrids prepared via a sol-gel method is presented. The dye molecules can be incorporated into the silica matrix by forming weak or covalent bonds (hybrids of classes I and II, respectively). New class II samples and traditional class I materials prepared by the predoping method were synthesized. Samples were characterized by photoluminescence measurements to compare the emission properties and the photostability of the samples. The decay of the fluorescence signal as the cumulative excitation energy increases is reported and interpreted by hypothesizing that the dye molecules can be hosted in different surroundings within the porous glass matrix. The reported photoluminescence and photobleaching features indicate the class II samples as good candidates for solid-state dye lasers.\", \"In this study, a different UV (ultra-violet) ray absorption system is presented in which butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMDM, a model UV-A absorbent, 320-400 nm) is stabilized in phase-controlled poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) microspheres. The photochemistry of BMDM in the microspheres was investigated considering its phase characteristics therein. Analysis by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction showed that the BMDM in the microspheres was present in a non-crystalline state. The phase control of BMDM in the polymer microspheres has an excellent ability to protect against UV-A, whilst maintaining its photostability and thermal stability. The results obtained in this study illustrate well that the phase control of the UV absorbents in polymer microspheres is another key factor that determines their photochemistry and photostability in the final formulations.\", \"Degradation of liquid crystal cell under a blue-violet laser beam irradiation has been investigated for an evaluation of a LC cell photostability. The laser beam was focused on the LC layer in the cell. A far field pattern (FFP) was caused by the change of the LC alignment at the focused point after a few minutes irradiation. The FFP changed as a progress of the alignment degradation and it depended on LC materials, polymer materials and their combinations.\", \"Dye-doped deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA)-tetradecyltrimethylammonium (TTA) films have been prepared. Rhodamine 6G, known as laser dyes, can be spontaneously doped by immersing the DNA-TEA film in rhodamine 6G-acetonitrile solutions. It is surmised that rhodamine 6G monomers and dimers diffuse within the hydrophobic TEA sites, and then monomers presumably intercalate between adjacent base pairs of DNA. Optical absorption spectra reveal that rhodamine 6G molecules in the sample undergo an unusual transformation from the dimer state to the monomer state with the elapse of time. Rhidamine 6G molecules doped in DNA-TEA show enhanced photostability and concentration quenching than those in PMMA. The environment, conformation and chemical stability of rhodamine 6G are different between DNA-TEA and PMMA, and are presumably modified by the intercalation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The mechanisms of the effect of ionic interactions on the probabilities and channels of electronic transitions in the nanoparticles are discussed.\", \"Fluorescent organic nanoparticles (NPs) are attractive alternatives to quantum dots due to their potential biodegradability. However, preparation of fluorescent organic NPs is challenging due to the problem of self-quenching of the encapsulated dyes. Moreover, the photostability of organic dyes is much lower than that of quantum dots. To address both problems, we studied encapsulation into biodegradable polymer PLGA NPs of perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives, which are among the most photostable dyes reported to date. Two PDIs were tested, one bearing bulky hydrophobic groups at the imides, while the other was substituted in both imide and bay regions (Lumogen Red). Encapsulation of the former resulted in aggregation, which was accompanied by the emission color change from green to red, some decrease in the fluorescence quantum yield and a significant drop in the photostability, unexpected for PDI dyes. In contrast, Lumogen Red showed nearly no aggregation inside polymer NPs and maintained high quantum yield and photostability. According to wide-field fluorescence microscopy with a 532 nm excitation laser, our 40 nm PLGA NPs loaded with 1 wt% Lumogen Red were >10-fold brighter than quantum dots (QD-585). These NPs were stable in biological media, including serum, and entered spontaneously into HeLa cells by endocytosis showing no sign of cytotoxicity. Due to excellent photostability, these nanoparticles could be considered as biodegradable substitutes of quantum dots in bioimaging.\", \"The red fluorescent protein variant TagRFP-T has greatly improved photostability over its parent molecule, TagRFP, but the underlying mechanism leading to this improvement is to date unknown. The 1.95 angstrom resolution crystallographic structure of TagRFP-T showed that its chromophore exists as a mixture of cis and trans coplanar isomers in roughly equal proportions. Interestingly, both isomers are able to fluoresce, a property that has never been observed in any other fluorescent protein. We propose a \\\"circular restoration model\\\" for TagRFP-T to explain its superior photostability: There are four co-existing chromophore states (cis/trans protonatediionized state) that can be driven by light to transform from one state into another. This model also explains how TagRPF-T essentially eliminates the temporary dark state (reversible photobleaching). (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Photodegradation of a drug can considerably modify its pharmacokinetic behavior by varying the therapeutic index. The evaluation of the degradation profile of a drug, according to the ICH rules, is of primary importance in developing an appropriate topical formulation. Advanced strategies have been proposed to increase the protection from the light of the photolabile drugs. Supramolecular systems have been investigated to improve both pharmacokinetic profile and photostability.

It was shown that zinc dipyrrinates with substituted pyrrole rings and a methene spacer exhibited an intense fluorescence in nonpolar media. The phenyl-substituted complex had an order of magnitude stronger fluorescence than the methyl-substituted analog. Changing from a methene spacer to a nitrogen atom caused a substantial (up to 64 nm) red shift of the electronic absorption spectrum, and the chelate completely lost its fluorescent properties. The effects of the chelate ligand structure on the photostability of zinc(II) complexes were established.\", \"The synthesis of five new reactive triazine azodyes and their intermediates was investigated.

Cotton fabrics were dyed and their color characteristics were measured. The dyes copolymerized with acrylamide (ACA) and acrylonitrile (AN) and the copolymers with an intense orange color that is stable to solvent extraction were obtained.

MD was treated with a preselected solvent by stirring a drug suspension in the solvent in a predetermined solid/solvent ratio under controlled conditions. At the end of the solvent treatment period, MD powder was separated, dried and screened. Changes in the solid-state properties of surface-treated MD were monitored using flowability measurements, scanning electron microscopy, thermal analysis and dissolution rate. Further, photostability testing, according to the ICH guidelines, was conducted using compressed disks of MD treated with solvents in the absence and presence of antioxidants, namely ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and cysteine HCl. The color change (Delta E) was determined according to the CIELAB system. Surface treatment of MD drug substance with ethanol, methanol and isopropanol resulted in a marked improvement in flowability which was associated with morphological crystalline changes. Treatment of MD with methanol provided free flowing spherical agglomerates. Disks of solvent-treated MD showed improved photostability which was further potentiated by the inclusion of antioxidants, although only traces of the antioxidant were retained in the treated powder.

Antioxidant activity study demonstrated that trans-resveratrol loaded microemulsions exhibited higher scavenging activities than both trans-resveratrol and blank microemulsions. The cell experiments demonstrated that RO-ME and JO-ME had lower cytotoxicity on HaCaT cells than LO-ME. The trans-resveratrol loaded RO-ME and JO-ME could significantly protect the cells from UVB damage. Finally, the in vitro skin permeation study exhibited that the microemulsions could enhance the skin permeation of trans-resveratrol in comparison to the aqueous solution.

Methods: The inclusion complexes of sunscreen agents with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) in aqueous solution and solid phase were studied by UV-vis spectrophotmetery, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and (13)C-NMR techniques. The photodegradation reaction of the sunscreen agents' molecules in lotion was explored using UV-vis spectrophotometry and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results: The formation of the inclusion complexes was confirmed experimentally using DSC, SEM, and (13)C-NMR. The results of spectrophotometric and HPLC studies have shown that the inclusion complexation with HP-beta-CD has the potential to enhance the photostability of the selected sunscreen agents in lotion. HPLC results indicated that HP-beta-CD has approximately increases the photostability of Oct by six- to eightfold. Moreover, the presence of HP-beta-CD in lotion controlled the isomerization process of Cin to a certain degree, which was found to be a function of the amount of HP-beta-CD added.

However, the detection of low concentrations of GFPs is limited by the weakness of the fluorescent signal and the low photostability. In this report, we observed the proximity of single GFPs to metallic silver nanoparticles increases its fluorescence intensity approximately 6-fold and decreases the decay time. Single protein molecules on the silvered surfaces emitted 10-fold more photons as compared to glass prior to photobleaching. The photostability of single GFP has increased to some extent.

The use of silylated laser dyes allows for covalently bonding the laser dyes to their hosts. Photostability of the samples was evaluated by measuring the decrease in the dye absorption in the Polyceram upon ultraviolet lamp exposure and by monitoring the fluorescence intensity as function of pump pulses from a N-2 laser at 337 nm. Both methods showed a significant improvement in photo- and thermal-stability of the silylated dye Polyceram compared to that of the unsilylated dye Polyceram at a dye:Si mole ratio of 10(-4):1. The improved stability is attributed to the immobilization and higher degree of caging of the silylated dye Polyceram with respect to the unsilylated dye Polyceram.\", \"Polarization resolved fluorescence from single molecules was measured from rhodamine 6G (R6G), sulforhodamine B (SRB), Ore-on Green 514 (ORG), and didodecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DilC(12)) embedded in silica sol-gel thin films in contact with water and ethanol. Positively charged R6G was found to be firmly immobilized, regardless of the solvent medium. Despite its net negative charge, zwitterionic SRB was found mostly immobilized in both solvent media. The immobilization of SRB was attributed to a delicate balance of Coulombic interaction, hydrogen bonding, and molecular imprinting effect. While R6G showed a significant decrease in photostability in a solvent medium because of enhanced solvent interactions, hydrogen bonding appeared to effectively retard the molecular motions of solvated SRB such that its photostability exceeded those in dry films. The mobility of negatively charged ORG was found to be moderately enhanced through repulsion, but Coulombic force was not as influential as hydrophobic interaction, which was responsible for the high mobility found for DiIC(12) in dry films. When in water and ethanol, the hydrophobic chains of DiIC(12) were pushed by the solvent toward the less polar silica matrix, forcing DiIC(12) to the solid-liquid interface and transforming a substantial amount of tumbling DiIC(12) into intermediate DiIC(12). Since the photostability of DiIC(12) is closely related to the dynamics associated with its hydrophobic chains, DiIC(12) in both water-covered and ethanol-covered films displayed comparable photostability because of the similar silica environment surrounding the hydrophobic chains.\", \"Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 is recognized as a promising method to reduce CO2 emission and produce available chemical energy simultaneously. CdS-based photocatalysts have been intensively studied for CO2 reduction, due to their excellent optical response and suitable band structures.

The experimental results show that the modification of ZIF-8 shell can not only improve the photostability of CdS, but also enhance its CO2 adsorption capacity without impairing its light harvesting ability. CdS/ZIF-8 catalyst shows higher efficiency and better selectivity than that of unmodified CdS in photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO, which is attributed to its higher CO2 adsorption capability.

HPLC analysis was used to determine the extent of photodegradation. XRD results showed that changes in the TPH crystal structure had occurred during irradiation and that these changes increased with the time of irradiation. Although the potential for isomerization under the influence of UV-light to the pharmaceutically inactive Z-isomer exists, results have proved that this transformation for solid-state TPH would require more extreme light conditions. The results of this study thus illustrate the general light stability of TPH in the solid-state.\", \"We synthesized solubilized alkoxysilane-modified perylene derivatives which were covalently attached to an inorganic host matrix, prepared via the sol-gel process.

Furthermore, we found that modifying the inorganic network. with organic groups caused better solubility characteristics for the perylene derivatives. Attachment of the alkoxysilane-modified perylene derivatives was improved using a more reactive network precursor such as zirconium n-propoxide.

However, no generic methodology has been proposed to systematically analyze the photodamage of the fluorogen and the protein tag. Using Y-FAST (Yellow Fluorescence-activating and Absorption-Shifting Tag) as a case study we propose here a generic experimental and theoretical approach to assess how fluorogen renewal reduces the apparent photobleaching rate of a fluorogenbinding tag. Y-FAST has its apparent photobleaching rate greatly reduced by fluorogen renewal and its photostability is mainly limited by oxidation of specific residues in the protein scaffold by reactive oxygen species generated by the bound fluorogen.

The photostability of conjugated polymer nanoparticles and CdSe quantum dots was compared, at both the ensemble and single particle level. The results provide confirmation of the hypothesis that quenching by photogenerated hole polarons is a key factor limiting the fluorescence quantum yield and maximum emission rate in conjugated polymer nanoparticles.

Our study of bacteria labeled with RH-414, a membrane marker, reveals that increasing the duration of the STED pulse from similar to10 to 160 ps fundamentally improves the photostability of the dye. At the same time the STED efficiency is maintained. The observed photobleaching of RH-414 is due primarily to multiphoton absorption from its ground state.

The decomposition products were identified by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Comparing the behaviors of different MEHs under different conditions indicates that the hydrolysis is catalyzed by OH-and thus MEHs are more stable at a lower pH.

Such derivatives showed bands similar to those of boldine in the absorption and emission spectrum. The spectroscopic properties are pH dependent. The photostability of the derivative compounds was higher than that of boldine, in accordance with the low value of the photoconsumption quantum yield determined. The low fluorescence quantum yield values observed for boldine 1 and 4 as both base and hydrochloride derivative compounds led us to postulate that these compounds are deactivated by a mechanism different to the fluorescence pathway, probably due to the electron-withdrawing inductive effect of NO for boldine 1, and to the increase of the aromatic framework for boldine 4.\", \"Two new families of compounds, the 3(5)-(1'-hydroxy-2'-naphthyl)pyrazoles (a series) and the 3(5)-(2'-hydroxy-1'-naphthyl)pyrazoles (b series), have been synthesized and fully characterized.

The photostability of a representative set of such derivatives was also determined, showing that the existence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond (IMHB) is not an essential condition for providing UV stability. Moreover when such an IMHB is present in the molecule, the photostability is not dependent on whether the proton is transferred or not.\", \"Monitoring mitochondria morphological changes temporally and spatially exhibits significant importance for diagnosing, preventing and treating various diseases related to mitochondrial dysfunction.

The influence of protonation, nonplanar structure of the molecule, and reactivity of NH bonds on the photostability of porphyrins and their analogs has been shown.\", \"The kinetics of photolysis of ascorbic acid in cream formulations on UV irradiation has been studied using a specific spectrophotometric method with a reproducibility of +/- 5%. The apparent first-order rate constants (k (obs)) for the photolysis of ascorbic acid in creams have been determined. The photoproducts formed in the cream formulations include dehydroascorbic acid and 2,3-diketogulonic acid. The photolysis of ascorbic acid appears to be affected by the concentration of active ingredient, pH, and viscosity of the medium and formulation characteristics. The study indicates that the ionized state and redox potentials of ascorbic acid are important factors in the photostability of the vitamin in cream formulations. The viscosity of the humectant present in the creams appears to influence the photostability of ascorbic acid. The results show that the physical stability of the creams is an important factor in the stabilization of the vitamin. In the cream formulations stored in the dark, ascorbic acid undergoes aerobic oxidation and the degradation is affected by similar factors as indicated in the photolysis reactions. The rate of oxidative degradation in the dark is about seventy times slower than that observed in the presence of light.\", \"In the last decades solid-state tunable lasers were prepared by embedding dye molecules into sol-gel matrix. The main advantage with respect to the liquid dye solution is the decrease of health and environmental hazards. However the desired dye photostability, which is mainly related to the photochemical degradation of organic molecules in their gain range, has not yet achieved. In this work we present a photostability study of porous silica-rhodamine 6G hybrids (PS-R6G) prepared via sol-gel method. Two kinds of samples were prepared: class I and II, where the dye molecules are weakly and covalently bonded to the glass matrix, respectively. Measurements were carried out by exciting PS-R6G samples with the 3rd harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm) at-different power densities. We observed the decay of the fluorescence signal as the cumulative excitation energy increases in both the sets of samples. The photobleaching rate depends both on the power density and the kind of the samples. The photoluminescence properties and the photobleaching feature reported indicate the class H samples as good candidate for solid-state dye laser. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore HI-6 is a promising candidate for the development of new antidotes against nerve agents. For ethical and safety reasons antidotes containing HI-6 should get marketing authorization. Active pharmaceutical ingredients of medicinal products have to fulfil regulatory conditions in terms of purity and stability. Photostability is an essential parameter in this testing strategy. HI-6 was tested under conditions of ICH Q1B Photostability testing of new drug substances and products. The data showed a marked degradation of HI-6 after exposure to daylight. The mechanism of degradation could be detected as photoisomerism. The light burden dependent rate of photoisomerism was followed quantitatively. Based on these quantitative results on the amount of light induced isomeric product a pharmacological qualification was made. A standardized in vitro test showed a decreased ability of light exposed HI-6 to reactivate sarin- and paraoxon-inhibited human acetylcholinesterase. These results have an impact on the further development of antidotes containing HI-6, as light protection will probably be necessary during handling, packaging, storage and application.

Unfortunately, the oral absorption of ATRA is highly variable. Its poor aqueous solubility also makes it difficult to be formulated into parenteral formulation To date, there is no parenteral formulation of ATRA available commercially. O\\nbjective: To undertake the preformulation work necessary for developing such a product.\\nMethod: We investigated the solubility and stability profile of ATRA in various formulations.\\nResults: The aqueous solubility of ATRA could be greatly increased by the inclusion of ATRA in 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD). Adjusting the pH value further improved the water solubility of ATRA. The photostability of HP-beta-D-based formulation of ATRA was evaluated and it was found that inclusion ATRA into HP-beta-CD did improve the photostability of ATRA.\\nConclusion: These results showed that it is possible to develop a parenteral formulation and/or an aqueous oral formulation of all-trans-retinoic acid by using 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin. However, the biopharmaceutical properties of such a formulation would be necessary before its use.\", \"Wethers sourced from a Merino genetic resource flock, selected on the basis of their measured wool clean colour at 2 years of age, were stratified on the basis of clean colour and allocated to one of four treatment groups in a 2 x 2 factorial design. The aim was to investigate the effect of coating the fleece and administration of a commercial mineral supplement on brightness, clean colour and photostability over a 12-month period when run on the Central Tablelands of NewSouth Wales. Coating the fleece significantly improved both the brightness and clean colour of the fleece (P < 0.001, by 4 and 0.5 T units, respectively), but had no effect on the photostability of the two traits. The mineral supplement had no significant impact on the colour or photostability traits and there was no evidence of an interaction between coating the fleece and the mineral supplement. Although the improvements in brightness and colour arising from coating the fleece complemented the predicted responses to genetic selection for these two traits, the combined effect would not be sufficient to replace the routine use of oxidative bleaching during processing.\", \"Oxygen-free strontium fluoride crystals containing single monovalent silver ions in a cubic site were grown. Our experiments showed that the Ag+ ion remained chemically stable upon optical irradiation at 222 nm (KrCl excimer). The ion exhibits a strong UV luminescence which presents no thermal quenching up to RT. At this temperature, the emitting level time-constant is 12 mu s. An explanation is proposed for the silver photostability by relating it to the large electronic bandgap of the host (11.4 ev). The 222 Mn absorbing level lies below the conduction band in a way such that photoionization of Ag+ is avoided, as well as other optically-induced opacity phenomena. A minimum source intensity at threshold is estimated at some 276 kW, when using a Fabry-Perot cavity. This power can normally be achieved with the excimer laser.\", \"The photo-physical properties of Xanthene dyes: Basic Rhodamine Yellow (BRY), Rhodamine590perchlorate (R590p), SulforhodamineB (SRB) doped in tetramethylorthosilicate (TMOS) and poly-methylmethacrylate (PMMA) are observed. The various parameters viz. full-width at half-maxima (FWHM), peak emission wavelength, quantum yield and excited state lifetime at different concentrations ranging from similar to 0.05 to similar to 1 mM of the dye under excitation by Copper Vapor Laser (CVL) of high repetition rate (similar to 5.6 kHz) of are investigated. In order to identify photostability in dyes, normalized photostability has been studied and found that silica gel samples containing dye are more stable than that of polymeric samples. This has been further understood in terms of number density of unbleached dye molecules that infers that photobleaching of dye molecules is not prominent at higher concentrations in glassy solid matrices. Pump intensity dependent optical gain of the samples has also been reported and efforts have been made to study the efficiency of solid-state laser samples in a cavity for the performance of the dye laser.

In the present study, the photostability of an orange-red and a yellow fungal pigment extract produced by ascomycetous fungi belonging to the genera Penicillium and Epicoccum, respectively, were studied in a soft drink model medium and in citrate buffer at low and neutral pH. The quantitative and qualitative color change pattern of the fungal pigment extracts indicated an enhanced photostability of fungal pigment extracts compared to the commercially available natural colorants Monascus Red and turmeric used as controls. Yellow components of the orange-red fungal pigment extract were more photostable than the red components. Chemistry of the photodegradation of the orange-red pigment extract was studied by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS), and a light-induced formation of a structural analogue of sequoiamonascin C, a Monascus-like polyketide pigment discovered in the extract of Penicillium aculeatum IBT 14263 on yeast extract sucrose (YES) medium, was confirmed in the soft drink medium at pH 7.\", \"Quercetin can bring many benefits to skin based on its various bioactivities. However, the therapeutic effect of quercetin is limited due to the poor water solubility, pH instability, light instability, and skin permeation. The aim of the present work was applying essential oil-based microemulsions to improve the solubility, pH stability, photostability, and skin permeation of quercetin for topical application. Peppermint oil (PO-ME), clove oil (CO-ME), and rosemary oil (RMO-ME) were selected as model essential oils. Microemulsions composed of Cremophor EL/1,2-propanediol/essential oils (47:23:30, w/w) were selected as model formulations, based on the pseudo-ternary phase diagram and the characterizations. In the solubility study, the solubility of quercetin was improved dozens of times by microemulsions. Quercetin was found instable under alkaline condition, with 50% degraded in the solution of pH 13. However, PO-ME, CO-ME, and RMO-ME could protect quercetin from the hydroxide ions, with 47, 9, and 12% of quercetin degraded. In the photostability study, the essential oil-based microemulsions showed the capability of protecting quercetin from degradation under UV radiation. Where more than 67% of quercetin was degraded in aqueous solution, while less than 7% of quercetin degraded in microemulsions. At last, the in vitro skin permeation study showed that the essential oil-based microemulsions could enhance the permeation capacity of quercetin by 2.5-3 times compared to the aqueous solution. Hence, the prepared essential oil microemulsions could improve the solubility, pH stability, photostability, and skin permeation of quercetin, which will be beneficial for its topical application.\", \"Combining multiple organic dyes to form a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) network is a useful strategy for extending the spectral range of sunlight absorbed by a luminescent solar concentrator (LSC). Excitation transfer out of the higher energy level dyes in the transfer series competes effectively with their photodegradation rates. Improvements in photostability up to a factor of 18 are observed for the first dye in the FRET series. FRET networks are shown to be a viable means of decreasing the rate of photodegradation of organic dyes used in LSCs. This comes at the expense of the final dye in the network; the depository of most of the excitations created by absorbing sunlight. The photostability and performance of an efficient FRET LSC rest heavily on the photostability and fluorescence quantum yield of the final dye. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we present a UV transmission spectrum measurement system utilizing a high-sensitivity UV photomultiplier tube with concomitant evaluation of photostability. We have developed an algorithm to estimate SPF in vitro by converting the amount of UV light transmission through the sunscreen layer into cumulative relative erythema effectiveness to obtain one minimal erythema dose. Thus, the algorithm uses the same endpoint as in vivo SPF methods, but with a photomultiplier tube as the detector instead of skin. The values obtained showed an excellent correlation with in vivo SPF values, even for high-SPF sunscreens exceeding SPF 50. This method should be suitable as an in vitro SPF testing method for regulatory purposes.\", \"A family of anthracene carboxyimides with multi-color fluorescence have been successfully prepared, and their spectroscopic properties were investigated by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. The photostability and solvatochromic fluorescence in organic solvents were also investigated. The parent anthracene carboxyimide 4a displays very strong green fluorescence (Phi(F) = 0.91 in EtOH), good pH stability and photostability, as well as a large Stokes shift. By attachment of different substituents at the 10-position of the anthracene carboxyimide, the fluorescence maxima could be effectively modulated from 500 nm to 615 nm. The 10-(picolylamine) substituted anthracene carboxyimides 5a and 5b exhibit large Stokes shifts (>80 nm) and significant positive solvatochromic fluorescence in organic solvents due to their intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) character. Furthermore, cell staining experiments indicate that anthracene carboxyimides have excellent cell membrane permeability and good photo-bleaching resistance in living cells. Particularly, compound 5a is a specific mitochondria-targeting dye with red fluorescence. All these features enable anthracene carboxyimides to serve as promising candidates for bio-labeling/imaging applications.

The polymer matrix was synthesized by the prepolymer method. The prepolymer, obtained from hexamethylene diisocyanate and oligodiethyleneglycol adipinate, was hardened by trimethylolpropane. The production method of the laser sandwich-like active media based on xanthene and pyrromethene dyes was described; their spectral, photo-physical and generation characteristics were investigated. Significant increase in the beam strength of the polymer matrix, the growth in efficiency and stability of the active elements are observed due to the peculiarities of aliphatic polyurethane chemical structure. The main reason for the high photostability and operation lifetime of laser polyurethane-based active elements was shown to be the absence of reactive radicals.\", \"Photostability of an antidepressant agomelatine under the simulated solar radiation was studied. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of this process was performed with the use of UHPLC-DAD system coupled with a high resolution hybrid ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometer. In contrast to the foregoing studies agomelatine turned out to be relatively photolabile compound. During the experiment six transformation products were formed, and their structures were elucidated on the basis of MS/MS fragmentation spectra. Four of these photoproducts were found to be a result of aromatic and aliphatic hydroxylation. Additionally, identified products were submitted to the in silico toxicity evaluation, which showed that some of them could be more mutagenic or toxic to rodents than the parent compound.\", \"ZnO nanoparticles are prepared by green synthesis using Moringaoleifera natural extract.

Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurement showed that the PL dynamics was evolved from tri-exponential decay to bi-exponential type with the increase of the shell thickness, and the PL decay characteristics of these giant QDs did not evidently change under long-term UV irradiation, indicating that the thick shell could isolate the effect of the surface's defects on the exciton's recombination within these QDs.

Its accumulation in the extracellular sheaths allows the bacteria to thrive in inhospitable locations highly exposed to solar radiation. Scytonemin is often referred to as photostable and has been reported to be non-fluorescent. Taken together, these properties indicate inherently fast non-radiative relaxation processes. Despite these interesting traits, the photophysics of scytonemin is as yet almost completely unexplored. In this study, we have compared the steady-state photophysics of scytonemin itself and four derivatives thereof. Furthermore, the in vitro photostability of scytonemin was studied in different solvents using a solar simulation system. Scytonemin and the investigated derivatives demonstrated a more rapid photoinduced decay in comparison with two commercial UV-screening agents. The photostability could be modulated by varying the solvent, with the protic solvent ethanol providing the most stabilizing environment.\", \"The sol-gel process provides a low temperature chemical route for the preparation of rigid transparent matrix materials. Under this process, luminescent organic dye molecules were incorporated into organically modified silicate (ORMOSIL) host matrices.

The photochemical mechanisms of the dye response under N-2 laser irradiation were studied using UV and fluorescence spectra measurement. The evolution of the maximum of the emission and excitation curves as function of accumulated irradiated energy was fitted by exponential equations. The matrix protects the dye from the oxidation and dimerization reactions. The dye molecules exhibited photobleaching due to their photodegradation.

In this study, an in-depth investigation of the photostability of terbinafine, in both solutions and formulations, was conducted, taking into account the presence of UV absorbers such as TiO2, ZnO, avobenzone, 3-(4-methylbenzylidene)camphor, octocrylene, benzophenone-1 and benzophenone-2. The clear photocatalytic degradation of terbinafine in ethanol solution was observed in the presence of TiO2 and/or ZnO. In other cases, terbinafine was stable, with the exception of, in the presence of octocrylene. The presumed degradation products of terbinafine were identified for the first time using LC/MS/MS, and transformation pathways were proposed. In the case of a cream formulation, the percentage of initial terbinafine content was almost unchanged in the presence of the UV absorbers benzophenone-1, benzophenone-2 and 3-(4-methylbenzylidene)camphor. In vitro cytotoxicity risk assessment of terbinafine based on photostability under UVA irradiation was evaluated using the human skin fibroblast BJ (ATCC (R) CRL-2522 (TM)), and this showed no statistically significant difference in cell viability for all samples analyzed.\", \"Organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit spectacular changes in the photovoltaic area, but they still face the challenges of full spectral utilization and photostability under continuous light irradiation. The ultraviolet (UV) part in sunlight could induce oxygen vacancy in the mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) layer, resulting in the degradation of perovskite photoactive films and the rapidly decreased device performance. In this work, we demonstrate that an effective luminescent downconversion material, Eu(TTA)(2)(Phen)MAA (ETPM), can be used as an interfacial modifier between the m-TiO2 layer and the perovskite photoactive layer to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 17.00 to 19.07%. The improved device performance can be ascribed to the effective utilization of incident UV light and reduced carrier recombination. Meanwhile, the conversion of the UV light by ETPM could inhibit the stability loss of the device under irradiation. As a result, the modified PSCs can maintain 86% of their initial value under continuous light soaking for 100 h, higher than that of 40% for the control device. This work indicates that the introduction of the luminescent downconversion material ETPM can successfully improve the PCE and photostability of PSCs.\", \"Poly(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole)/poly(pyridobisimidazole) block copolymers (PBO-b-PIPD) were prepared by introducing poly(pyridobisimidazole) (PIPD) moieties into the main chains of poly(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) in order to enhance its photostability. PBO and copolymer fibers were directly prepared from the polymerization solutions by dry-jet wet-spinning. Chemical structures and molecular chains arrangement of the block copolymers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, solid-state C-13-NMR and wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). Thermal stability of the copolymers was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in nitrogen. Thin films of PBO and copolymers were cast from methanesulfonic acid (MSA) solutions. Both the films and fibers were exposed to UV light to determine their photostability. Changes in the chemical structures and surface morphologies of the films were characterized by FTIR spectra and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), respectively. After UV light exposure, the retention of strength for copolymer fibers is improved compared to PBO fibers. The results revealed that copolymers suffered less photodegradation in comparison with homopolymer. The mechanism for the improved photostability of the copolymers was discussed.\", \"Photodissociation dynamics for various tryptophan chromophores was studied at 193 or 248 nm using multimass ion imaging techniques. The competition between internal conversion to the ground electronic state and dissociation from the repulsive excited state reveals size-dependent photostability for these amino acid chromophores. As the size of chromophore increases, internal conversion to the ground state becomes the major nonradiative process. For tryptophan and larger chromophores, dissociation directly from the repulsive state is completely quenched.

However, the poor photostability of CdS in aqueous solution seriously prevents its practical application. Although efforts have been made, it still challengeable to improve stability while maintaining initial photo-current. Herein, a highly efficient photoanode system consisting of Al-doped ZnO nanorod arrays (NRs) served as effective electron-transfer layer and CdS as a light harvesting layer was designed. At last, TiO2 protective layer was deposited onto Al-ZnO/CdS photoanodes through atomic layer deposition (ALD) to enhance the photo-stability. The integrated Al-ZnO/CdS/TiO2 photoanode exhibits a photocurrent of 11.7 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen potential (RHE) and conversion efficiency of 5.9 % at 0.48 V versus RHE for 60 ALD TiO2 cycles. More importantly, the photostability of Al-ZnO/CdS/TiO2 photoanode was significantly prolonged comparing with the untreated Al-ZnO/CdS photoanode. The strengthen stability is benefited from the triple functions of ALD TiO2 layer, that is, isolating the direct contact between the photoanode with the surrounding liquid environment, passivating the surface state of the CdS, and capturing as well as storing the photogenerated hole.\", \"Results of a survey on photostability testing of drug substances and products by UK pharmaceutical laboratories are presented. The results indicate diverse practices in the form of presentation of the product and particularly in exposure to light (as measured in lx days), although there was more consistency in analytical methods and in the analytical criteria used to classify products as stable or unstable for those laboratories adopting this type of classification. A majority of laboratories use daylight in addition to artificial light sources for tests on drug substances and products. Artificial daylight fluorescent tubes and xenon lamps are the most widely used sources of artificial light and both should provide a reasonable simulation of natural light. All laboratories intend their photostability tests to represent light exposure which exceeds that expected to occur in practice but the tests actually applied vary widely in severity as shown in the wide range in light exposure (8-4500 klx days). Therefore the classification of products as stable or unstable needs to be considered carefully in relation to the severity of the test used.\\nTesting procedures for drug substances are broadly similar to those used for drug products. It is concluded that the variation in testing procedure is the result of differing perceptions regarding product exposure in practical usage and the absence of regulatory guidelines.\", \"Many pyrromethene (PM) dyes have been shown to outperform established rhodamine dyes in terms of laser efficiency in the green-yellow spectral region, but their rapid photochemical degradation in commonly used ethanol or methanol solvents continues to limit its use in high average power liquid dye lasers. A comparative study on narrowband laser efficiency and photostability of commercially available PM567 and PM597 dyes, using nonpolar n-heptane and 1,4-dioxane and polar ethanol solvents, was carried out by a constructed pulsed dye laser, pumped by the second harmonic (532 nm) radiation of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. Interestingly, both nonpolar solvents showed a significantly higher laser photostability (similar to 100 times) as well as peak efficiency (similar to 5%) of these PM dyes in comparison to ethanol. The different photostability of the PM dyes was rationalized by determining their triplet-state spectra and capability to generate reactive singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) by energy transfer to dissolved oxygen in these solvents using pulse radiolysis. Heptane is identified as a promising solvent for these PM dyes for use in high average power dye lasers, pumped by copper vapor lasers or diode-pumped solid-state green lasers.

Chitosan/tripolyphosphate (TPP) nanoparticles loaded with flavonoids-enriched vegetable extracts (Ginkgo biloba L., Dimorphandra mollis Benth, Ruta graveolens, and Vitis vinifera L.) were produced and characterized for their morphology, mean particle size, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency. A final topical formulation was obtained by dispersing chitosan/TPP nanoparticles in an o/w emulsion. Results showed that nanoparticles dispersion exhibited yellowish color, spherical shape, and uniform appearance. Extract-loaded chitosan/TPP nanoparticles showed a mean particle size of 557.11 +/- 3.1nm, polydispersity index of 0.39 +/- 0.27, zeta potential of +11.54 +/- 2.1mV, and encapsulation efficiency of 75.89% of rutin. The recorded texture parameters confirm that the developed formulation is appropriate for skin application. The SPF obtained was 2.3 +/- 0.4, with a critical wavelength of 387.0nm and 0.69 UVA/UVB ratio. The developed formulation exhibited photostability, allowing the release of flavonoids from nanoparticles while retaining rutin into the skin in a higher extension.\", \"We present the photostability results of seven novel electro-optic chromophores made to be used in highspeed fiber optic signal modulators. We measured the photobleaching rate of the chromophores at room temperature by using a fiber optic pump-probe technique. Thin polymer film guest-host samples were deposited on the end of SMF-28 fiber pigtails and bleached by using 100 mW of 1550 nm radiation as the pump. The bleaching rate was measured by monitoring the main absorption band of the chromophores by using a 660 nm probe beam that was multiplexed into the fiber pigtail. The relative photostability was reported as a figure of merit which is proportional to the I/e bleaching lifetime of the chromophore. We found the bleaching rate to increase linearly with incident 1550 nm power at the end of the single-mode fiber up to at least 100 mW. Our results show that the photobleaching rate is reduced dramatically when the test is conducted in an inert atmosphere. We also show that the presence of the singlet oxygen quencher DABCO can be used to increase the lifetime of the chromophore. The effect that chromophore structure and polymer host type have on photostability are also discussed.\", \"Hybrid perovskites are on a trajectory toward realizing the most efficient single-junction, solution-processed photovoltaic devices. However, a critical issue is the limited understanding of the correlation between the degree of crystallinity and the emergent perovskite/hole (or electron) transport layer on device performance and photostability. Here, the controlled growth of hybrid perovskites on nickel oxide (NiO) is shown, resulting in the formation of thin films with enhanced crystallinity with characteristic peak width and splitting reminiscent of the tetragonal phase in single crystals. Photophysical and interface sensitive measurements reveal a reduced trap density at the perovskite/NiO interface in comparison with perovskites grown on poly(3,4-ethylene dioxy thiophene) polystyrene sulfonate. Photovoltaic cells exhibit a high open circuit voltage (1.12 V), indicating a near-ideal energy band alignment. Moreover, photostability of photovoltaic devices up to 10-Suns is observed, which is a direct result of the superior crystallinity of perovskite thin films on NiO. These results elucidate the critical role of the quality of the perovskite/hole transport layer interface in rendering high-performance and photostable optoelectronic devices.\", \"Despite extensive research on carbon dots (CDs), rare studies have been performed on the photostability of CDs. Here, the photostability of CDs synthesized with 3-aminobenzoic acid were systematically investigated under different pH conditions (5.0, 7.4 and 9.0). The results showed that under Xenon lamp irradiation, the fluorescence (FL) intensity of the CDs exhibited an increase first and then a decrease, with a gradual shift of the maximum emission wavelength to longer wavelength. Further investigation indicated that the irradiation induced the change of the CD surface functional groups and gave rise to aggregation, resulting in the formation of larger particles. This study provided important reference value towards research on CDs properties.

Solid-state dye lasers based on pyrromethene 567 doped poly(methyl methacrylate) with an added singlet oxygen quencher 1,4-diazobicyclo [2,2,2] octane (DABCO) showed a lifetime of 550,000 pulses. A triplet quencher, perylene, provided no improvement. Singlet oxygen quenching is effective in the solid-state whereas triplet quenching is not, presumably due to the slower diffusion rate of dye molecules compared with oxygen.\", \"Retinyl palmitate (RP) is a derivative of Vitamin A and widely applied as the active component in the fields of cosmetic and pharmaceutics. RP can easily lose its physiological activity under UV irradiation due to its photosensitivity.

By contrast, the activity of RP in conventional hydroxyethyl cellulose gels only remained 10% under the same conditions. These results showed that the supramolecular gels exhibited a significant protective effect on the photostability of RP. UV spectra of RP in supramolecular gels and corresponding solutions showed no distinct differences, indicating no change of the physicochemical properties of RP. The images of field-emission scanning electron microscopy and fluorescent optical microscopy suggested that the protection by supramolecular gels on the photostability of RP may be attributed to the three-dimensional network structure formed by the self-assembly of the gelators, which reduced the molecular collisions and the degradation process of the photoactivated RP. The present results showed that this protection can be influenced by the structures and the concentration of gelators as well as by the solvent composition.\", \"The use of ionic liquids (ILs) as milieu materials for laser dyes is a promising field and quite competitive with volatile organic solvents and solid state-dye laser systems. This paper investigates some photophysical parameters of fluorescein dye incorporated into ionic liquids; 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMIM Cl), 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroaluminate (BMIM AlCl4) and 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIM BF4) as promising host matrix in addition to ethanol as reference. These parameters are: absorption and emission cross-sections, fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield, in addition to the transition dipole moment, the attenuation length and oscillator strength were also investigated. Lasing characteristics such as amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), the gain, and the photostability of fluorescein laser dye dissolved in different host materials were assessed. The composition and properties of the matrix of ILs were found that it has great interest in optimizing the laser performance and photostability of the investigated laser dye. Under transverse pumping of fluorescein dye by blue laser diode (450 nm) of (400 mW), the initial ASE for dye dissolved in BMIM AlCl4 and ethanol were decreased to 39% and 36% respectively as time progressed 132 min. Relatively high efficiency and high fluorescence quantum yield (11.8% and 0.82% respectively) were obtained with good photostability in case of fluorescein in BMIM BF4 that was decreased to similar to 56% of the initial ASE after continuously pumping with 400 mW for 132 min.

In this study, the yellowish green color of fluorescein dye was encapsulated into colloidal silica nanoparticles by using micelle entrapment approach. Two different size of silica nanoparticles encapsulated fluorescein dye (27.7 +/- 5.6 and 46.73 +/- 4.3 nm) with spherical and monodispered of nanoparticles were synthesised by varying the volume of co-solvent during the synthesis process. The particles size, particles morphology, absorption spectrum and the photostability of fluorescein dye was measured by using dynamic light scaterring (DLS), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and UV-Vis spectrometer. Furthermore, the effect of photostability of of silica nanoparticles encapsulated fluorescein dye was measured under radiation of 200 W of Halogen lamp for 60 minutes. The silica nanoparticles encapsulated fluorescein dye was more stable compared to bare fluorescein dye after the exposure. In conclusion, the photostability of silica nanoparticles encapsulated fluorescein dye was improved compared to bare fluorescein dye, thus silica nanoparticles encapsulation successfully provides protection from the photobleaching and photodegradation of fluorescein dye.\", \"The spectroscopic properties of 1,4,170 and 750 oxazine dyes doped in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) were measured and studied. The photostability of these samples were outdoor tested during the four seasons. The optical efficiency of luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) of 750 oxazine dye was measured and calculated hourly for one year (1995-1996) considering day 21 as a reference day for each month. The performance of LSC has been tested at three different positions using X-Y tracker.\", \"Polymer dispersed liquid crystal films incorporating dichroic dyes can be used to produce highperformance reflective displays using either glass or plastic substrates. The absorbance of PDLC films is predictable, based on a simple alignment model. The photostability properties of the dichroic dyes is an important device criterion. The photostability of dyes can depend on the choice of substrate. With plastic substrates dye fading occurs under aerobic conditions, while in glass substrates any photoreactions are anaerobic in nature; these differences can lead to significant lifetime differences in displays.\", \"The direct and simple fluorination of representative organic laser dyes with emission covering the entire visible spectrum, from blue to red, including Coumarin 460, Pyrromethene 546, Rhodamine 6G and Perylene Red, enhances laser efficiencies by a factor up to 1.8 with respect to the corresponding non-fluorinated parent dyes. More importantly, fluorination also significantly enhances the photostability of the dyes, even under drastic laser pumping conditions.\", \"The precision in localizing a molecule is ultimately determined by the number of detected photons, which is in turn limited by photobleaching. Currently, fluorophores can be routinely localized to a few tens of nanometers at room temperature. In this work we demonstrate localization precision better than 3 Angstrom by substantial improvement of the molecular photostability at cryogenic temperatures. We discuss the challenges, solutions and promise of our methodology for high-performance co-localization and super-resolution microscopy.\", \"Feruloylated soy glycerides (FSG) are a natural-based, ultraviolet (UV) absorbing, antioxidant vegetable oil synthesized from the lipase-catalyzed transesterification of ethyl ferulate and soybean oil. Commercial broad spectrum UV absorbing formulations contain multiple UV absorbing compounds that absorb UV radiation in specific regions. The most commonly used compounds are avobenzone (AVO, (max) 356nm) and octinoxate (ONX, (max) 310nm), which absorb primarily ultraviolet A and ultraviolet B radiation, respectively. The FSG chromophore is chemically similar to ONX but has a (max) of 328nm, approximately the median (max) of AVO and ONX. Equimolar mixtures of AVO-ONX and AVO-FSG, 50M:50M, solutions in ethanol were compared to determine whether FSG was fungible for ONX in total absorbance capacity, photostability when exposed to UV radiation, and broad spectrum absorbance coverage before and after exposure to UV radiation. While it was determined that AVO-FSG mixtures possessed statistically indistinguishable total absorbance capacity compared to AVO-ONX solutions, AVO-FSG possessed slightly better photostability after 4 hours of UV exposure based on 95% confidence interval comparisons from weighted regression equations. Substituting FSG for half of the ONX (e.g., 50M:25M:25M AVO-ONX-FSG) resulted in the best mixture with total absorbance capacity and photostability statistically equal to the AVO-ONX mixtures but with statistically superior broad spectrum UV absorbance compared to AVO-ONX and AVO-FSG mixtures. The natural, vegetable oil-based FSG can be substituted on an equimolar bases for ONX in mixtures with AVO to produce formulations with similar to superior efficacy.\", \"Determining liability of photosensitive compounds during manufacturing, packaging, and storage remains a challenge for formulation scientists prior to the confirmatory photostability studies as per International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Q1B guideline. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of light exposure to bulk process intermediates and drug product in the manufacturing environment as well as to evaluate package configurations for tablets containing Compound A. Samples were analyzed for both photodegradant levels and tablet appearance. Final blend, uncoated tablets, and coated tablets were exposed to fluorescent light relevant to the manufacturing environment. Final blend presented linear photodegradant growth from 6 to 72 h of equivalent light exposure in the manufacturing environment. Change in color of uncoated tablets occurred before quantifiable levels of photodegradant were reached. The film-coated tablets did not show photodegradation above quantifiable levels or a color shift for up to 48 h. Tablets in open conditions and packaged in HPDE bottles and PVC/Aclar (clear and opaque) were exposed to light at 1 x and 3 x the cumulative light exposure as defined in the ICH Q1B using Option 2 as the light source. The results showed that photodegradation is not a concern for all package configurations investigated and that extreme light exposure may cause a slight color shift for tablets in packages made of transparent materials. Most importantly, the study design presented herein provided a framework for an end-to-end evaluation of risks of manufacturing and packaging of tablets containing photolabile compounds prior to performing confirmatory photostability studies.\", \"A novel pyridine-phenol boron complex[(dppy)BF] was encapsulated into polymer/silica composite matrix by sol-gel process. UV-Vis absorption spectra show that this process can control the aggregation structure of complex (dppy)BF. The results of photo luminescence of (dppy)BF in sol-gel composite film indicate that both fluorescence intensity and photostability are markedly increased using this method compared with other methods, which increases the practical significance of such composite film.\", \"Recently, loading ligand-protected gold (Au) clusters as visible light photosensitizers onto various supports for photoredox catalysis has attracted considerable attention. However, the efficient control of long-term photostability of Au clusters on the metal-support interface remains challenging. Herein, we report a simple and efficient method for enhancing the photostability of glutathione-protected Au clusters (Au GSH clusters) loaded on the surface of SiO2 sphere by utilizing multifunctional branched poly-ethylenimine (BPEI) as a surface charge modifying, reducing and stabilizing agent. The sequential coating of thickness controlled TiO2 shells can further significantly improve the photocatalytic efficiency, while such structurally designed core-shell SiO2-Au GSH clusters-BPEI@TiO2 composites maintain high photostability during longtime light illumination conditions. This joint strategy via interfacial modification and composition engineering provides a facile guideline for stabilizing ultrasmall Au clusters and rational design of Au clusters-based composites with improved activity toward targeting applications in photoredox catalysis.\", \"Anisotropic gold nanostructures prepared by the seed method in the presence of Ag ions have been used to study their photostability to low-power UV irradiation (254 nm) at room temperature. It has been observed that, whereas spheres are very stable to photoirradiation, rods and prisms suffer from photocorrosion and finally dissolve completely with the production of Au(III) ions. Interpretation of these differences is based on the presence of semiconductor-like Ag clusters, adsorbed onto rods and prisms, able to photocorrode the Au nanoparticles, which are absent in the case of Au spheres. We further show direct evidence of the presence of Ag clusters in Au nanorods by XANES. These results confirm a previous hypothesis (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2014, 136, 1182-1185) about the major influence of very stable small Ag clusters, not only on the anisotropic formation of nanostructures but also on their photostability.\", \"The effect of doping with SrSiO3 in the range of 1 to 17.5 mass % on the reflectance spectra and integral solar absorptance factor of ZrO2 powders and their stability at ultraviolet irradiation were investigated. It was founded that the powders doped with I mass % of SrSiO3 Possess the greater photostability. Two types of thermal control coatings were fabricated. The first one was based on the undoped ZrO2 pigment and the second one was based on the ZrO2 pigment doped by I mass % of SrSiO3. The comparative investigations of their optical properties and photostability show that the coating based on doped pigment is more effective than the coating with undoped pigment. The prediction of optical properties degradation for these coatings was made for a lifetime of 10 years according to obtained data. This prediction may be used for altitudes of 600-800 km, for which the main damaging factor is ultraviolet radiation of the sun.\", \"The use of sunscreen preparations is recently growing and their efficacy and safety must be taken into account since they are applied on the skin frequently and for many hours. Exposition to sunlight, in fact, can cause sunscreen photodegradation and determine their decrease in UV protection often with the occurrence of allergic and/or toxic degradation products. A high photostability is hence very important for their effectiveness and safety.\\nThe aim of this work is to obtain new sunscreen formulations stabilized by intercalating PABA, within the lamellar structures of two kinds of hydrotalcite. PABA was chosen as model sunscreen because of its high photoinstability and photosensitizing properties that nowadays bar its utilization. Both intercalated products showed an increased protection range and, in one case, an improved sunscreen photostability.\\nSunscreen release from creams containing intercalated or free PABA was evaluated as well. The very low or negligible sunscreen release, obtained from the intercalated product loaded formulations, resulted in a lack of a close contact between skin and filter with the consequence that cutaneous reactions and allergy problems are eliminated.\\nThe use of these materials resulted in a good strategic technological approach in order to increase efficacy and safety of solar products.

A lower stability of air-exposed dimethylformamide solutions is observed and is due to a specific affinity for molecular oxygen revealed by the Pc macrocycle. SEM results proved oxygen molecules fixed to the phthalocyanine solids by forces strong enough to sustain desorption under vacuum. Absorption curves determined for MPc-DMF systems also indicate oxygen accommodated by the phthalocyanine moiety. This explains the predominantly oxygen-mediated photolysis. as well as the yen, short fluorescence lifetimes of metal phthalocyanines. The effect of air-absorbed moisture on the photostability is much less pronounced and practically insignificant for concentrations of H2O lower than 1%. An apparent stabilizing effect of water was observed and elucidated basing on kinetic considerations. The degradation rate of the photoexcited plithalocyanine moiety in air-exposed solutions depends oil individual chemical properties and the molecular structure of the complex.

Both the degradation of lycopene and the consumption of dissolved oxygen followed a first-order kinetics model. There was a proportional relationship between the degradation content of lycopene and the consumption of dissolved oxygen. These results indicate that dissolved oxygen would also be involved in the photolysis of lycopene.\", \"Photostability was studied and quantum yields of singlet oxygen in air-saturated dimethyl sulfoxide were determined for phenyl-substituted zinc complexes of porphyrin and porphyrazine and their annelated analogs. It is found that the photochemical properties of the complexes are stronger affected by linear annelation of the macroring than its angular annelation. In whole benzene annelation in the macroring of porphyrins reduce their photostability and quantum yield of singlet oxygen, while phenyl substitution favors generation of singlet oxygen.\", \"This study demonstrates that arginine is a highly effective solvent additive which significantly reduces the light induced aggregation of four IgG1 type monoclonal antibodies (named as IMC-1A, IMC-1B, IMC-1C and IMC-1D) as measured by size exclusion chromatography. All experiments were performed in a phosphate buffer system containing either sodium chloride or arginine hydrochloride. The protein samples were exposed to light in a photo chamber according to ICH (International Conference on Harmonization) guidelines. Thermal unfolding transition temperature (T(m)) of IMC-1A as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was significantly decreased (similar to 3.3 degrees C) in the presence of arginine hydrochloride as compared to in sodium chloride. However, a noticeable increase in thermal stability was observed for IMC-1B, IMC-1C and IMC-1D in the presence of arginine hydrochloride. The photostability of all these molecules was significantly enhanced by arginine hydrochloride and both a direct and inverse correlation was observed between conformational stability and photostability. To our knowledge, this paper for the first time, demonstrates that arginine hydrochloride considerably reduces the light induced aggregation of monoclonal antibodies. Arginine hydrochloride is also known to increase protein solubility and its ability to extensively reduce light induced aggregation makes it a potential solvent additive for the formulation development of therapeutic proteins.\", \"Doped polymers exhibit many attractive features for nonlinear optics. The performance demonstrated with some of these materials appears promising for application in real devices. However, the Achilles' heel of this class of chromophore-doped materials lies most certainly in their relatively modest chemical stability, especially their photostability. Our aim has been to quantify such \\\"side-effect\\\" phenomenon, systematically linked to the optical use of these materials.\\nPhotodegradation is a 2-step process: first, absorption, that may be characterized by sigma(lambda), the absorption cross section, and, second, chemical reactivity from the induced excited-states, which may be quantified by B-1(lambda), the overall quantum efficiency of degradation. The photodegradation rate under a photon flux n is thus given by tau =B/(sigma .n). We use the quantity C=B/sigma as a material figure of merit for photostability.\\nGiven long enough illumination times, C can always be measured. How precisely B is quantified is directly related to how precisely sigma is measured, which decreases dramatically as the wavelength of interest is shifted from the main absorption band towards the IR telecommunication spectral windows. Increasing future device lifetimes requires a simultaneous increase in the B parameter and a decrease in the loss due to the residual red-tail absorption.\\nWe report the systematic behavior that was found concerning the dependence of C on wavelength.\", \"The goal of this study is to investigate commercially available cosmetics (foundations, skin care creams) which also claim to include a sun protection factor (SPF). Are these products, which are not considered sunscreen products, helpful or could they be harmful? Using an in vitro method, we tested the effectiveness of 35 commercially available products against UVB and UVA radiation. For each product, our testing focused on determining the following four values in terms of current legal recommendations: SPF, UVA protection factor (PF-UVA), UVB/UVA ratio and critical wavelength (lambda(c)). We also tested each product's level of photostability. Effectively, when considering instructions for use (skincare products are applied once, in the morning) any product displaying an SPF must be particularly photostable, since its labeling does not indicate reapplication. In contrast, the packaging on sunscreen products clearly indicates the necessity of frequent reapplication. Out of the 35 products we tested, seven do not comply with legislation regarding sunscreen products. This non-compliance translates into insufficient protection against UVA radiation. The products sold in pharmacies did comply. In terms of photostability, only eight products out of the original 35 proved to be sufficiently photostable. It would seem inappropriate to use filters in the formulas of non-sunscreen cosmetics.\", \"Although the present-level quantum dots (QDs) exhibit excellent photoluminescent performance, their photostability under a prolonged photoexcitation stays doubtful and still unsatisfactory from an industrial perspective, since it determines the reliability of QD-incorporated devices such as QD-lightemitting diodes (QD-LEDs). In the present work, the overcoating of red-emitting InP/ZnS QDs with the oxide phase of In2O3 is attempted to suppress the QD photooxidation, thus rendering them highly photostable. The efficacy of the oxide overlayer in substantially alleviating the QD photodegradation is verified through a comparative photostability test, where two colloidal solutions of bare versus In2O3-overcoated InP/ZnS (InP/ZnS@ In2O3) QDs are identically subjected to a continuous UV irradiation for an extended period of time. Furthermore, both InP/ZnS and InP/ZnS@In2O3 QDs are packaged as color-converters with a blue LED chip, and the operational stability of the fabricated QD-LEDs is examined at a forward bias of 60 mA. Consistent with the results of UV irradiation experiment, InP/ZnS@ In2O3 QD-LED exhibits a superior device stability against a continual operation as compared with InP/ZnS one. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper describes the application of a new particulate carrier to improve OMC safety and photostability. The UV filter was included into the pores of the mesoporous silicate MCM-41 and then entrapped there by plugging the pore openings. The last step was performed treating the MCM-41 inclusion product with a lipid cosmetic ingredient by the hot-melt method. The loaded samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and N2 adsorption isotherms. Photochemical studies demonstrated that the coated samples allow a broader photoprotection range and remarkable improvement of sunscreen photostability. Finally, they were properly formulated in an emulgel, and the sunscreen release was studied in vitro by Franz diffusion cell and compared with those obtained from the same formulation containing the free filter. Sunscreen release from the studied formulations resulted negligible, meaning that the proposed approach represents a valuable strategy for UV filters stabilization toward light and safety improvement.

To determine the theoretical performance of acceptors, the Forster radius was determined. The practical performance was determined by measuring FRET efficiency and photostability of tandem fusion proteins in mammalian cells. Our results show that mNeonGreen is the most efficient acceptor for mTurquoise2 and that the photostability is better than SYFP2. The non-fluorescent YFP variant sREACh is an efficient acceptor, which is useful in lifetime-based FRET experiments. Among the orange and red fluorescent proteins, mCherry and mScarlet-I are the best performing acceptors.

The developed SLN were characterized for particle size, polydispersity index, entrapment efficiency of TRE and morphology. Studies were carried out to evaluate the ability of SLN in improving the photostability of TRE as compared to TRE in methanol. Encapsulation of TRE in SLN resulted in a significant improvement in its photostability in comparison to methanolic TRE solution and also prevented its isomerization. Furthermore, the skin irritation studies carried out on rabbits showed that SLN based TRE gel is significantly less irritating to skin as compared to marketed TRE cream and clearly indicated its potential in improving the skin tolerability of TRE.

The lasing threshold is found to increase with concentration, with the lasing threshold for 0.1 wt% being 75.8 +/- 9.4 MW cm(-2) and the lasing threshold for 0.5 wt% being 121.1 +/- 2.1 MW cm(-2), with the linewidth for both concentrations found to be approximate to 10 nm. We also consider the material's photostability and find that it displays fully reversible photodegradation with the photostability and recovery rate being greater than previously observed for DO11/PMMA without NPs. This enhancement in photostability and recovery rate is found to be explicable by the modified correlated chromophore domain model, with the NPs resulting in the domain free energy advantage increasing from 0.29 eV to 0.41 eV. Additionally, the molecular decay and recovery rates are found to be in agreement with previous measurements of DO11/PMMA (Ramini et al 2013 Polym. Chem. 4 4938).

The photostability of grafted veneers during natural weathering was compared with veneers treated with 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (DHBP) or chromium trioxide. In the presence of dimethylbenzylamine, at temperatures in excess of 80 degrees C, HEPBP reacted with wood resulting in permanent weight gains. FTIR and XPS spectra suggested grafting of the benzophenone to wood. Grafting of HEPBP restricted losses in veneer mass and tensile strength during weathering, whereas DHBP was ineffective. Grafting was generally as effective as chromium trioxide in restricting losses in veneer mass during weathering, and superior to chromium trioxide in terms of its effects on tensile strength. Grafting also reduced photochemical changes at exposed wood surfaces and improved the performance of clear finishes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.

Benzophenone-3 (BP-3) was used as a photostabilizing agent.Methods: The gel-cream developed (D-GC) containing BP-3 at 0.1% was prepared and characterized regarding its pH, drug content, spreadability, viscosity, in vitro drug release and in vitro permeation. The in vivo anti-inflammatory effect was assessed by ear edema measurement, croton oil-induced acute skin inflammation and myeloperoxidase assay.Results and Discussion: D-GC presented characteristics compatible with topical application, appropriate drug content and good spreadability, and non-Newtonian behavior with pseudoplastic flow. D-GC showed a good photostability profile, presenting a desonide content of 95.70% after 48h of exposure to UVA radiation, and stability under room conditions during 60 days. The amount of desonide released from D-GC and C-GC was 57.8 and 51.7 mu g/cm(2), respectively, measured using the vertical Franz cell. The in vitro skin permeation showed that desonide reached the site of action of the topical corticosteroids, from both formulations; however, the desonide amount retained in the dermis was lower with D-GC. The in vivo evaluation of topical anti-inflammatory activity indicated that D-GC presented the same biological effect as C-GC.Conclusion: D-GC represents a promising approach to treat dermatological disorders, since it presented satisfactory physicochemical characteristics, the same biological activity as C-GC and superior photostability, conferred by the addition of BP-3 at 0.1%.\", \"Three new heptamethine thiapyrylium dyes containing a disubstituted amino group on the meso position in their bridged chain were investigated. 4.30 to 5.10% of the pump energy was converted to an intense infrared pulse with wavelength between 1.35 and 1.65 mu m. The relation between lasing efficiency and dye concentration was also studied. These dyes show a remarkable photostability upon 1.06 mu m laser excitation and excellent storage stability without degassing.\", \"Several novel water-soluble asymmetric pentamethine cyanine dyes were synthesized. The maximum absorption and emission wavelengths of the dyes in different solvents were in the range from 647 to 665 nm and exhibited negative solvatochromism with increasing solvent polarity. The fluorescence quantum yields of the dyes were about 0.1 in water, and were obviously higher than those of hydrophobic cyanine dyes. Dyes with N-benzyl groups and N-sulfo-groups displayed greater photostability than dyes with N-carboxypentyl groups in water. The limit of detection of dye 5a for BSA was 1.2 x 10(-8) mol L-1 by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescent director about 100-fold lower than that by UV detection (1.0 x 10(-6) mol L-1). Therefore, Dye 5a could be used to improve photostability and detection sensitivity in protein analysis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

When these 4-alkyl-1,4-dihydropyridines were irradiated with a multilamp photoreactor (band centred at 350 nm), both exhibited a slow photodegradation showing first-order kinetics. The photodegradation rate constants were 0.37 h-1 for PCA-4248 and 0.39 h-1 for PCA-4230 in oxygenated conditions. The photodecomposition was slower for both drugs in the absence of oxygen.\\nIn order to evaluate the phototoxicity induced by these drugs, red blood cells and Hep-2 (human laringo carcinoma cell line) were irradiated using a minisolarium, which emits UVA radiation (350-390 nm). The results showed that PCA-4248 and PCA-4230 did not exhibit a phototoxic effect in the two models tested.\", \"Bleached wool is rapidly yellowed by exposure to the UV radiation present in sunlight. The conventional application of a water-soluble hydroxyphenyl benzotriazole UV absorber (such as UVFast W) to bleached wool reduces its rate of photoyellowing but has a negative impact on the whiteness of the bleached wool, largely cancelling out the improvements in whiteness achieved during bleaching. However, if the UV absorber is applied to peroxide-bleached wool from a reductive bleach bath, white wool with improved photostability to sunlight and UV radiation can be obtained.\", \"A stability high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method is proposed as suitable to assess the photodegradation of nicardipine.HCl solutions. The method was validated with particular regard to selectivity. The application of such a procedure to the study of the degradation rate of nicardipine.HCl under both UV and daylight conditions is illustrated. Further structural studies were performed, by means of mass spectrometry, on the main degradation product collected from HPLC: this allowed its identification as the pyridine analogue of nicardipine.\", \"The effect of the doping of titanium dioxide powders with potassium peroxoborate on the photostability of reflecting coatings based on these powders is investigated. An increase in the stability of the diffuse reflection spectra and of the total absorptance on exposure to radiation that imitates the solar spectrum is established for oxidant concentrations tip to 30 mass % with saturation of the efficiency at a concentration of 15 mass %. It is demonstrated that, on irradiation, the doping leads to a decrease in the absorption bands of color centers caused by defects of the anionic sublattice.\", \"The photostability of tamoxifen citrate polymorphs, forms A and B, was investigated by chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses including high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPI-C), colorimetry and UV/vis solid-state absorption spectroscopy. On the basis of the results of photostability studies under irradiation by visible light and both UVA (320-400 nm) and a fraction of UVB (290-320 nm) light, form A was chemically unstable, whereas form B was stable against light irradiation. The surface color of pellets prepared with any of these crystal forms turned from white to brown; however, the extent of color change in cross-sections of form A pellet was deeper than that of form B pellet. The maximum peak of UV/vis solid-state absorption spectra of form A was observed at 337 nm within the UVA range and was in longer wavelength regions than forrn B, which exhibited the strong UV absorption mainly in UVB and UVC region. The results obtained suggested that the photodegradation followed by surface color change of form A crystal was caused by the selective absorption of photoenergy of UVA light irradiated by a xenon lamp.

The effect of different side chains, including -H, alkyl, alkoxy, and aryl moieties, over polymer stability is examined. Thin films were processed and submitted to photooxidative degradation. We experimentally confirm that alkoxy side chains are the most promising candidates for designing soluble and photo-resistant polymers. This conclusion is modulated by the polymer dispersity which also plays an important role: a low dispersity value being synonymous of higher photostability. The reasons why the side chain structure and dispersity value drive the polymer photostability are discussed. For the design of photo-resistant polymers and devices, side chain selection must go hand in hand with the control of the synthesis meaning a low dispersity.\", \"In this study, the photostability of wood polymer composites (WPC) was assessed by using ultra-violet accelerated weathering test. Meanwhile, the mechanical properties of WPC show strength improvement at prolonged UV irradiation exposure with 43.21 MPa and maximum strain of 4.08 % at 5000 hours and 1000 hours UV irradiation exposure respectively. The colour stability of WPC was improved by addition of Ultraviolet (UV) stabilizer during pre-mixing process which shows positive effect on the colour stability and prevented chalking of the composites for external use. Generally, discolourations of WPC during test exposure were caused by degradation of both wood and plastic. Therefore, incorporation with pigments and other additives gives improvement to the photostability of WPC. This is based on the increment of WPCs mechanical property while the morphological fracture surface of dumbbell test specimens revealed the pull out rice husk fiber which contributed to the distribution of load in the WPC samples.\", \"Ag-based compounds are regarded as a new family of highly efficient visible-light-driven photocatalytic materials. However, in terms of photocorrosion nature of this type of photocatalyst, resulting in the serious deactivation, it is a huge challenge to develop simple and reliable strategies to synthesize Ag-based heterostructured nanostructures with good structural stability and high photoactivity. In this work, we have developed a facile reaction route, with visible-light induced reduction followed by an anion exchange, to prepare one-dimensional (1D) Ag2CO3/Ag/AgBr ternary heterostructured nanorods (HNRs) with tunable chemical compositions at room temperature. The as-obtained 1D Ag2CO3/Ag/AgBr HNRs exhibit significantly enhanced photostability and photocatalytic activity under visible-light illumination. The origin of enhanced photostability and photoactivity was further investigated by a radical-trapping test, and a possible Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism has been proposed.\", \"The photostability of menatetrenone in rape seed oil as a solvent was investigated under irradiation with a fluorescent lamp to obtain basic information on encapsulation of the drug. The drug was susceptible to degradation by visible light below 480 nm and was most strongly degraded at around 430 nm, showing wavelength dependency. The degradation followed apparently first-order kinetics for a given initial concentration and exhibited a concentration dependency. The greater the initial concentration, the smaller was the degradation rate constant. Semilogarithmic plots of the apparent degradation rate constant against the reciprocal of illuminance demonstrated a linear relationship similar to that of Arrhenius-type behavior, and prediction of photostability under ordinary illumination conditions was suggested to be possible from the data obtained under conditions of accelerated illumination. Geometrical scale factors relating to the dosage form were also investigated, and it was found that round capsules were the most favorable shape from the viewpoint of stability.\", \"The photophysical behavior of 1'-hydroxy-2'-acetonaphthone in dry cyclohexane, methanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide was studied. The compound was found to exhibit a single fluorescence band (both at room temperature and at 77 K) that was scarcely dependent on the solvent used as well as an anomalously small Stokes shift (ca. 6000 cm-1) for an excited-state intramolecular proton-transfer mechanism and a fluorescence spectrum similar to the mirror image of its absorption spectrum. The compound was also found to exhibit a single fluorescence band both in gas phase at 368 K and in crystal phase at 298 K. Despite the fact that the compound seemingly undergoes a proton phototransfer, it is no more photostable than 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methylphenyl)benzotriazole itself, which is regarded as the archetype of photostability. This finding sheds some light on the mechanism whereby substances containing an intramolecular hydrogen bond acquire their photostability.\", \"Tretinoin (TRE) is a widely used retinoid for the topical treatment of acne, psoriasis, skin cancer and photoaging. Despite unmatchable efficacy, it is associated with several vexatious side effects like marked skin erythema, peeling and irritation, eventually leading to poor patient compliance. Its photo-instability and high lipophilicity also pose challenges in the development of a suitable topical product. The present study, therefore, aims to develop biocompatible lipid-based nanocarriers of TRE to improve its skin delivery, photostability, biocompatibility and pharmacodynamic efficacy. The TRE-loaded liposomes, ethosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipidic carriers (NLCs) were prepared and characterized for micromeritics, surface charge, percent drug efficiency and morphology. Bioadhesive hydrogels of the developed systems were also evaluated for rheological characterization, photostability, ex vivo skin permeation and retention employing porcine skin, and anti-psoriatic activity in mouse tail model. Nanoparticulate carriers (SLNs, NLCs) offered enhanced photostability, skin transport and anti-psoriatic activity vis-a-vis the vesicular carriers (liposomes, ethosomes) and the marketed product. However, all the developed nanocarriers were found to be more biocompatible and effective than the marketed product. These encouraging findings can guide in proper selection of topical carriers among diversity of such available carriers systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

However, its main active constituent, 4-nerolydilcatechol (4-NC), is sensitive to ultraviolet and visible light, which can limit the use of intermediate and final herbal preparations of this species. In the present work, coated multiparticulate solid dosage forms of P. umbellata were obtained with the purpose of increasing the stability of 4-NC. P. umbellata extract was used as a wetting liquid for the preparation of pellets by extrusion-spheronization. Pellets were coated in a fluidized bed by three different polymers (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), polyvynilpirrolidone K-30 (PVP-K30), and polyvinyl alcohol-polyethylene glycol graft-copolymer (PVA-PEG)). 4-NC photostability was evaluated by an accelerated photostability protocol. Pellets showed a narrow size distribution and low friability. 4-NC photodegradation followed a second order degradation kinetics with similar k values for the percolate, uncoated pellets and HPMC coated pellets. Photoprotection was higher in pellets coated with PVP-K30 and PVA-PEG. PVA-PEG coated pellets with 6 and 9% weight gain resulted in a final concentration of 4-NC approximately cinco times higher than uncoated pellets or liquid extracts, suggesting the potential of this formulation as a multiparticulate solid dosage form for P. umbellata extracts.\", \"This study aimed to screen an effective flavonoid with promising whitening and antioxidant capacities, and design flavonoid-loaded niosomes to improve its solubility, stability, and penetration. In vitro anti-tyrosinase and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging experiments were conducted to investigate the whitening and antioxidant capacities of several flavonoids, including quercetin, morin, festin, myricetin, rutin, and breviscapine. The conductivity, viscosity, and particle size of Span60-RH40-based formulation of nonionic surfactant vesicles (niosomes) with different mass ratios were studied to determine the most appropriate formulation. Drug-loaded niosomes were characterized for size, zeta potential, morphology, and entrapment efficiency. The photostability, solubility, release behavior, ex vivo drug penetration, and skin retention were also studied. The results showed that quercetin has considerable whitening and antioxidant capacities and Span60-RH40 at a mass ratio of 9:11 forms spherical or oval niosomes of 97.6 +/- 3.1 nm with a zeta potential range of 31.1 +/- 0.9 mV, and drug entrapment efficiency as high as 87.3 +/- 1.6%. Niosomes remarkably improved the solubility and photostability of quercetin. Furthermore, compared to quercetin solution, quercetin-niosomes had the advantages of sustained release and improved transdermal penetration, with skin retention 2.95 times higher than quercetin solution.\", \"Sunscreens contain molecules with the ability to absorb and/or reflect UVA (ultraviolet A) and UVB (ultraviolet B) radiation, thereby preventing this radiation from reaching the epidermis or dermis. Their photo stabilities after exposure to UV radiation are well known and described, but there is little data on the stability of these filters after fluorescent indoors light radiation, such as from light emitted by commercial lamps present in homes and offices. Those lamps can expose people to varying levels of UVB, UVA, visible light, and IR (infrared). This study assesses the photostability of four different commercial products containing chemical sun filters after artificial UV and fluorescent irradiation, correlating the UVB and UVA absorption efficiencies of each product against the different types of radiation. The tested products were applied on a plate of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and irradiated by a solar simulator with specific filters for UVA and UVB and a commercial fluorescent light source. According to the results, three formulations did not show photostability, suffering significant changes in their UV absorption spectra, and one of the selected formulations can be considered photostable. This reinforces the importance of conducting stability studies for sunscreen formulations indifferent conditions, including under artificial (indoor) light exposure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ZnS capping of the CdTe QDs leads to significant enhancement of the fluorescence brightness of these QDs. Considerable enhancement of the photostability of the shell-protected QDs, including the suppression of photoactivation, is also observed. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements reveal an increase in the number of particles undergoing reversible fluorescent on-off transitions in the volume under observation with increasing excitation power; this effect is found to be more pronounced in the case of core-only QDs than for core-shell QDs.\", \"Red/near-infrared (NIR) light-emitting boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes bearing methacryloyl groups were synthesized, and these dyes were covalently bonded to poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) silica hybrids. The preparation of their hybrids was performed by simultaneous sol gel reaction of trimethoxy(methyl)silane and radical copolymerization of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) with the dyes under microwave irradiation or conventional heating. Strong red/NIR light-emitting hybrids without discoloration of the dyes were successfully obtained under microwave irradiation, whereas the dyes lost luminescent properties in the hybrids prepared under conventional heating. Photostability test of the hybrids showed that covalent attachment of the dyes led to significant improvement in the photostability in comparison with the solution state. Further, elution amount of the dyes from the hybrids in organic solvents decreased relative to that from physical dye-admixing hybrids due to the covalent bond between PHEMA and the dyes.\", \"novel kind of fluorescent nanoparticles (FNPs) has been prepared using a precipitation polymerization method.

Ag/ZnO particles could be prepared on large scale through this solution-solid process (about 1.5 g for each time synthesis and could be easily scaled up). Also, the result of photocatalytic test indicates that the material exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for the photodegradation of organic dye Rhodamine B.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of porous calcium silicate (PCS) for maintaining the photostability of NIF in a solid dispersion formulation. Adsorption solid dispersion (ASD) prepared using NIF and PCS as an amorphous formulation was more stable to light irradiation than a physical mixture of NIF and microcrystalline cellulose (a control physical mixture) as a crystalline formulation. In addition, PCS in physical mixtures with NIF adequately protected NIF from photodegradation, suggesting that this protective effect could be because of some screening effect by the porous structure of PCS blocking the passage of light reaching NIF in pores of PCS. These findings suggest that PCS is useful for improving the solubility and photostability of NIF in solid dispersion formulation.\", \"A linear cyanine dye (LDP) guest comprising two binding sites, one 4-[2-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]ethenyl]pyridinium group and one p-aminophenoxy ethylene group, was synthesized and proved could form inclusion complexes with cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) in aqueous solution. A partially encapsulated ([2]pseudorotaxane) state in which one CB[7] ring moved fast between the two binding sites was originally detected and was then transferred into a full encapsulated ([3]pseudorotaxane) state where two CB[7] macrocycles resided on both binding sites with the continuously adding of CB[7] to LDP.

To this end, we use the bianalyte technique with isotopically edited probes to provide the best-case scenario for the isolation of single molecule events, and study the statistics of EFs at different incident laser powers. When photo-bleaching stops playing an important role within the integration time used to capture the spectra, SM-SERS EFs approach an upper bound, which is in agreement with estimations of the EFs within the electromagnetic theory of SERS, enhancements.

There are some reports on the technological development of P. umbellate preparations; however, there are no studies on the influence of non-conventional extraction procedures on the quality of P. umbellate extracts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the ultrasound-assisted extraction (UE) parameters upon the extraction yield (EY%) of 4-nerolidylcatechol (4-NC) and the antioxidant activity of P. umbellate extracts using a factorial design and response surface methodology. Extracts obtained by UE and percolation were compared, and the photostability of 4-NC was evaluated via the exposure of UVA and visible light to the samples. The most influential variables observed for the UE were the ethanol-to-water and drug-to-solvent ratios. UE improved the extraction kinetics of 4-NC from plant material and improved the antioxidant activity of the extracts. Some of the ultrasound extracts showed an antioxidant activity that was not proportional to their 4-NC concentration, which suggests the presence of other active antioxidant compounds in these P. umbellate extracts. There was no significant difference in the photostability of 4-NC between the percolated and ultrasound extracts. Surprisingly, the isolated 4-NC material was significantly more stable when exposed to UVA-visible light compared to 4-NC in the plant extracts. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Remarkably, the ZnO powder via homogeneous precipitation (urea/Zn2+ = 2.0) exhibited better photocatalytic performance and photostability than those of flower-like ZnO substrate.

The resulting films show high transparency and exhibit a strong blue coloration upon irradiation with UV light. The composition of the embedding matrix has an important effect on the photostability of the photochromic molecules upon exposure to sunlight, and can therefore be used to design coatings in which the dye molecules have improved durability. In this sense, the incorporation of different amino groups (-PrNH2, -PrNMe2 and -PhNH2) in the ormosil network, results in an enhanced stabilization of the photochromic dye, as compared with unfunctionalized matrices. In matrices modified with aminophenyl groups (-PhNH2), the photostability of the dye has been increased, reaching a factor of 8, due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the amino groups and the OH groups of the pore surface, limiting the availability of these groups to undergo side reactions with the dye during irradiation that lead to its degradation. Increasing the photostability of the photochromic dye is an important issue for the long term usage of photochromic materials in outdoors applications, limited, nowadays, by their low durability when exposed to sunlight.\", \"Photoexcitation of fluorophores commonly used for biological imaging applications generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can cause bleaching of the fluorophore and damage to the biological system under investigation.

We also show that Cy5 generates significantly less ROS when covalently linked to the protective agents, cyclooctatetraene (COT), nitrobenzyl alcohol (NBA) or Trolox. Such fluorophores exhibit enhanced photostability both in bulk solutions and in single-molecule fluorescence measurements. While the fluorophores ATTO 647N and ATTO 655 showed greater photostability than Cy5 and the protective-agent-linked Cy5 derivatives investigated here, both of ATTO 647N and ATTO 655 generated singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals at relatively rapid rates, suggesting that they may be substantially more phototoxic than Cy5 and its derivatives.\", \"The structure and photostability of ternary methyl methacrylate copolymers with methacrylic acid and metal (sodium, barium, lead, and erbium) methacrylates colored by Rhodamine 6G were studied. It was established that, unlike methyl methacrylate-methacrylic acid copolymer. metal-containing copolymers and the dye incorporated into these copolymers are characterized by higher photostability, which increases in a sequence Na1+ < Ba2+ < Pb2+ < Er3+, depending on the nature of the salt cation. In addition to the direct photostabilizing action of salt groups, the observed effect can be related to the structural features of the copolymers. In the above sequence, the structure of the copolymers changes from linear to lightly cross-linked, the (stereo)regularity of macromolecular chains increases, as shown for the sodium methacrylate copolymer, and the dimensions and number of the ordered supermolecular structures grow. These changes create more favorable conditions for the dissipation and transfer of photoexcitation energy of macromolecules. It is demonstrated that lead and erbium methacrylate copolymers show promise as laser-active media.\", \"MgO nanocrystals were synthesized and doped with different concentrations in poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) to prepare hybrid organic-inorganic coatings based on polymer nanohybrid thin films. The nanoparticles were found to be spherical with 62 nm diameter as determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscope (AFM). The coatings were characterized by spectroscopic tools such as optical absorption, transmission and fluorescence spectroscopy. The prepared nanohybrid films were spin-coated on cost-effective luminescent PMMA substrates doped with highly efficient luminescent dyes luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs). The outdoor photostability tests demonstrated enhanced protection against UVA radiation for coated LSCs compared to bare LSC substrates. The current-voltage characteristics of commercially produced LSC prototypes showed that the poor UV response of monocrystalline silicon solar cell can be improved by for LSCs coated by PMMA/MgO nanohybrid films which act as luminescent down shifting layer (LDSL).\", \"A CdS encapsulated carbon nanotube (CNT) photocatalyst was prepared by a liquid-chemistry method. Through filling of CNTs with CdS, the aggregation of CdS was prevented efficiently by the good confinement effect of CNTs, and the photocatalytic performance of CdS was enhanced by 2.5 times via synergistic integration of the confinement effect of CNTs and heterojunction between CNTs and CdS. The photostability of CdS encapsulated in and attached on CNTs was investigated systematically through methylene blue photocatalytic degradation, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy. The results indicate that the photocorrosion of CdS is successfully suppressed when it is encapsulated in the CNTs. The mechanism analysis suggests that spatial synergy of the CdS and powerful adsorptivity of CNTs are the primary causes for photocorrosion inhibition. Our efforts propose a new scheme to remarkably promote both the photostability and photocatalytic activity of photocorrosion-susceptible photocatalysts.\", \"Quercetin, a plant-derived flavonoid, has been extensively investigated for a wide range of potential health benefits linked to its antioxidant properties. Unfortunately the topical administration of this molecule is restricted by its fast photodegradation. In the attempt to overcome this limitation the inclusion complex between quercetin (Q) and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (Me-beta-CD) was prepared and previously investigated by a molecular modelling study, a solubility diagram and a DSC analysis. Successively the kinetics of photodegradation, the antiradical, metal chelating and anti-lipoperoxidative activities were studied by comparing the complex with free Q. In addition the accumulation of Q in porcine skin was evaluated after in vitro topical application by means of vertical Franz cells. The complex formation resulted useful in enhancing the solubility of Q without significantly reducing its antioxidant ability. A modest improvement in the photostability was also observed.\", \"Derivatives and heteroarene analogs of alpha-T were synthesized and evaluated for their pesticidal activities. Studies on physical properties, photostability, and electronic calculations were also performed on selected analogs. In the nematicide water screen under sun light, some of these compounds were found to be very fast acting and were much more potent than oxamyl and parathion (EC50 = < 0.01 ppm at 2 hours). At 1 lb/acre postemergence application 5-chloro-5\\\"-methyloximino-alpha-T was significantly more active than alpha-T and completely controlled johnson grass, yellow foxtail, and morning-glory. However, selected analogs of alpha-T were found to have poor photostability, with half-life time ranging from 0.7 to 22 hours in thin film photostability studies under solar simulator. Electronic calculations were performed to study the effect of substitution on the ring conformation and the lowest triplet state energy. The calculation results were consistent with the lowest triplet state energy transfer mechanism for singlet oxygen formation.\", \"The relationship between photostability and conformation of 2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene (MEH-PPV) conjugated polymers was studied via excitation polarization modulation depth (M) measurements. Upon partial photobleaching, M distributions of collapsed, highly ordered MEH-PPV molecules shifted toward lower values. Conversely, M distributions of MEH-PPV molecules with random coil conformations moved toward higher values after partial photobleaching. Monte Carlo simulations of randomly distributed dipole moments along polymer chains subjected to partial photobleaching revealed that a statistical effect leads to an increase in peak M value. Decreases in M values seen experimentally in the population of MEH-PPV molecules with high M values, however, are due to conformation-dependent photostability within single MEH-PPV polymers. We show that, while folded MEH-PPV molecules are relatively more photostable than extended MEH-PPV molecules in an ensemble, extended portions of particular molecules are more photostable than folded domains within single MEH-PPV molecules.\", \"Sunscreens are thought to protect skin from many of the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) light and the photostability of sunscreens is thus an important concern in their application. Therefore, to discover new UV filters or to modify well-known UV filters are presents an important way for development of sunscreens. In this study, we presented several novel poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) encapsulated organic UV filters, including encapsulated benzophenone-3 (TB-MS), avobenzone (TA-MS), octyl methoxycinnamate (TO-MS) and diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (TD-MS). Our results have demonstrated that PMMA-encapsulated UV filters have improved safety, photoprotective ability and photostability. We proposed therefore that these PMMA-encapsulated UV filters can be used as ingredients for sunscreen products in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that heat treatment temperature is a conflicting factor to the photochromic intensity (Delta A(0)), photostability and abrasion resistance of the photochromic coatings. With increasing densification temperature the matrix rigidity increases leading to a decrease of Delta A(0) and at the same time an enhancement of both abrasion resistance and photostability, the optimum heat treatment temperature is 110 degrees C under our experimental conditions. By the use of certain additives, e.g., fluorosilanes (FAS), not only Delta A(0) but also the photostability and the abrasion resistance of the photochromic coatings have been further improved.\", \"The absorption and emission properties of eight organic compounds in silica gel matrices of different chemical compositions and different types (bulk samples and thin films) are studied upon excitation by a XeCl laser and the second harmonic of a Nd : YAG laser. The mechanisms of the laser-induced changes in the spectral parameters of molecules in silica gel matrices are discussed and the photostability of the laser dyes in silica gel films is estimated.\", \"Resveratrol is well known for its antioxidant activity and susceptibility to ultraviolet radiation. Development of formulations providing improved stability and relevant drug delivery of resveratrol is still a challenging task. The aim of this study was to determine protective characteristics of formulated microemulsions by evaluating photoisomerization of resveratrol and to investigate the effects of resveratrol on human keratinocyte cells under oxidative stress caused by ultraviolet radiation. Incorporation of resveratrol into microemulsions resulted in increased photostability of active compounds and the results demonstrated that photodegradation of resveratrol was significantly delayed. Results of biopharmaceutical evaluation in vitro demonstrated that up to 60 % of resveratrol was released from microemulsions within 6 hours under a constant release rate profile. In vivo biological testing confirmed the ability of resveratrol to protect cells from oxidative stress and to increase cell viability. It was concluded that microemulsions might be considered in the development of UV light sensitive compounds.\", \"Menadione (MD), also known as vitamin K3, has been widely applied in fortified food, feed, and the nutrition industry for its antihemorrhagic activity. However, the poor photostability in the solid state has greatly affected its biological performance and limited its applications. With the objective to alter the topochemical photoreactivity, a cocrystallization approach was employed, and three MD cocrystals with naphthoic acids and sulfamerazine were designed and prepared. Single crystal structures were determined, and solid-state characterization were performed. Solid-state UV-vis spectra revealed a significant red-shift of UV absorption in the cocrystal solids resulting in variant color differences. These physicochemical changes may be attributed to the enhanced pi---pi interactions and change-transfer interactions within these molecular complexes. More importantly, the newly synthesized cocrystals displayed better dissolution behavior and superior photostability with respect to MD itself. No obvious degradation was observed under stressed photoirradiation conditions. These findings may provide new possibilities to the application of this key vitamin.\", \"Laser operation and radiative properties of organically doped porous sol-gel silica have been studied using a range of cavities. Measurements of diffusion, distribution and long term photostability of dopant dye molecules are described. Laser oscillation at wavelengths of between 360 and 630 nm are reported. This represents a substantial increase over the range previously reported for organic dye doped silica lasers. In a Littrow configuration a tuning range of 60nm and a conversion efficiency of 16% have been observed. A linewidth of <0.05 nm has been obtained using a grazing incidence cavity.\", \"Photostability of the polymer solar cells (PSCs) remains a challenge to attain, as number of factors including the electron transport layers contribute to the degradation of PSCs when they are tested under 1 sun illumination, along with heat and humidity. Especially electron transport layers (ETLs) have considerable contribution to the overall degradations in these solar cells. Most studied ETL into the fabrication of inverted PSCs is zinc oxide (ZnO) yet the photostability of these PSCs is limited. This degradation most probably occurred due to the direct contact of zinc metal with the photoactive layer. This interface between ZnO and photoactive layer results in the initiation of degradations in PSCs. Keeping in view of this issue, we have modified the ZnO ETL by mixing ZnO nano particles with ethoxylated polyethyleneimine (PEIE) and then passivating this modified ZnO (m-ZnO) with ultrathin PEIE buffer layer. The power conversion efficiency is not affected by this approach, but when PSCs were subjected to 1 sun illumination, these m-ZnO/PEIE based PSCs have shown the enhanced light soaking (LS) stability. These findings indicate that optimizing the interface between the photoactive layer and the electron transport layer can lead to enhanced LS stability.\", \"The influence of different modifiers, phosphorus, potassium, aluminium, and cerium on the pigmentary properties of TiO2 was studied. The phase composition and distribution of modifiers in prepared TiO2 products was investigated using XRD analysis, the selective leaching method, and ICP-AES technique. The optical properties, photoactivity, morphology, and surface area of modified TiO2 were determined by spectrophotometric, fluorescent, SEM, and BET measurements. The research was directed towards obtaining a pigmentary TiO2 with the highest possible photostability. It was found that the final calcination temperature, at which the anatase-rutile transformation rate was > 97 %, depended on the kind and amount of the modifiers introduced into hydrated titanium dioxide. In comparing the colour of TiO2 products modified with Ce, it was found that the addition of K to the TiO2 series caused an increase in all the optical properties examined. The presence of K and Al in TiO2 modified with Ce resulted in decreased photocatalytic activity. The photostability of TiO2 modified with Ce and K improved with an increase in P2O5 content. The highest photostability was measured for the TiO2-CePKAl series. It was concluded that the differences in both the optical properties and photoactivity of TiO2 depended on its phase composition and the distribution of modifiers in the products obtained.\", \"UV irradiation of ethisterone (1) and norethisterone (2) in the solid state yielded one photoproduct each: 17,20-epoxy-17xiH-pregna-4,20-diene-3-one (3) and the dimerization product 17'-hydroxy-(13betaH,17'betaH)-13,17-seco-[20,21]bipregnayl-4,20,4'-trien-20'-in-3,17,3'-trione (4), respectively. Compounds 3 and 4 were characterized by their spectral and analytical data and further confirmed by the molecular packing of 1 and 2 in the crystal, as shown by X-ray crystallography.\", \"Computational and experimental studies have been performed to investigate the photostability of a series of 6,13-bis(arylalkynyl)-substituted pentacenes in the presence of oxygen. These studies indicate that photostabilization occurs through a selective LUMO orbital stabilization as has been seen previously for 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene. Marcus theory analysis suggests that the difference in vibrational reorganization energies across all compounds is small and that the thermodynamic driving force for forward electron transfer is primarily responsible for the observed photostabilization.\", \"The target of this research was to evaluate the photostability at various pH values of 1.20 x 10(-4) M aqueous solution of arbutin (lambda(max) = 267 nm; epsilon = 7500 M-1. cm(-1)). This photodegradation appeared to follow first-order kinetics whatever the pH. The degradation rate constant was calculated to be 5.5 x 10(-4), 7.0 x 10(-4) and 24.1 x 10(-4) min(-1), respectively at pH 5, 7 and 9, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

In this work, a type of structurally rigid organic ligand, 4-hydroxy-1,5-naphthyridine (ND), is developed, which can not only efficiently sensitize the europium emission but also demonstrate unique photostability. A series of ND derivatives with different substituent groups are synthesized and their singlet and triplet excited state energy levels are systematically investigated. Photophysical characterizations of the corresponding europium complexes reveal that the sensitization efficiencies ((sens)) are close to 100% and the total photoluminescence quantum yields can reach up to 84%. Most importantly, these structurally rigid luminescent europium complexes exhibit outstanding photostability and thermostability. Unlike the widely used -diketone complexes that are easily photodegraded, ND-based chelates show no obvious degradation during the UV aging test (10 W m(-2) 340 nm Ultraviolet A irradiation) within 200 h. Such superior UV resistance is even better than that of the famous compound tris(8-hydroxyquinolate)aluminum (Alq(3)). Possible reasons are discussed and a general rule for designing photostable LLCs is proposed. Such a chromophore is very promising for introducing luminescent materials with good photostability in potential application in many disciplines.\", \"Various symmetrical and unsymmetrical squarylium dyes have been synthesized and characterized with the aid of IR spectroscopy and solvatochromism. The photofading of squarylium dyes has been investigated in solution and in polyvinylbutyral (PVB) film with carbon are Fade-Ometer. The photostability of squarylium dyes increases with the electron-withdrawing power of substituent groups at the indoline moiety, The rates of photofading of these dyes were remarkably suppressed in the presence of hydroxycarboxylic acid metal salt, while the addition of UV-absorber afforded little retardation of the rate of fading.

Two polymerizable dyes, a combination of Fluorescein or Eosin with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, as well as two 9-phenylxanthene intermediates were synthesized in good yields under variable reaction conditions. Their light absorption and fluorescence properties in solution have been determined and discussed. Photooxidative stability of the new fluorophores has been studied and compared to other similar fluorescent dyes, not containing hindered amine fragment in their molecules. It was shown that the presence of a HALS (hindered amine light stabilizer) fragment in the dyes' molecules improved their photostability. The ability of the dyes to co-polymerize with vinyl monomers such as methyl methacrylate was demonstrated.

The as prepared products were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), energy dispersion spectrum (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) and photoluminescence spectrum (PL). The SF-CdSe QDs were about 5 nm in diameter and exhibited excellent water-solubility and photoluminescence properties. The cellular distribution, photostability and cytotoxicity of SF-CdSe QDs with different amount of SF coatings were also investigated by laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) and MTT assays in human pancreatic carcinoma (PANC-1) cells. All the results reveal that these QDs could be easily internalized by cells and localized in cytoplasm around nuclei. Moreover, SF-CdSe QDs were proved to be low cytotoxicity (the concentration of QDs < 5 mu g mL(-1)) and high photostability (the illumination energy density < 2 x 10(-5) W mu m(-2)) within PANC-1 cells, which was mainly due to the biocompatible silk fibroin. The resulted SF-CdSe QDs might have many potential applications in tumor imaging and therapy. And the synthesis strategy could be easily extended to fabrication of other nanoparticles coated with silk fibroin.\", \"In an attempt to develop photostable and efficient BODIPY (PM) dyes for use in liquid dye lasers, three new congeners of widely used laser dye, PM567, were synthesized and their photophysical properties in various organic solvents, laser performances, and photostabilities in a selected solvent, 1,4-dioxane, have been investigated using a frequency doubled Q-switched (10 Hz) Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm. The results of photostability study in nonpolar 1,4-dioxane revealed the remarkable enhancement in stability of the novel dyes compared to that of PM567 as well as improved laser performances. Cyclic voltammetry study strongly supports the observed enhancement in photostability of the novel dyes compared to that of PM567. The observed properties of the novel dyes in relation to those of PM567 have been rationalized by extensive use of DFT and TD-DFT using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) method of theory.\", \"Liposomes, in which beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin palmitate or beta-cryptoxanthin acetate had been embedded, were irradiated by UVA, and the rate of degradation of each carotenoid was measured. There was no significant difference in the degradation rate between beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin. The degradation rates of beta-cryptoxanthin palmitate and beta-cryptoxanthin acetate were faster than that of beta-cryptoxanthin, and the degradation rate of beta-cryptoxanthin pahnitate was faster than that of beta-cryptoxanthin acetate.\", \"A dramatic increase in the photostability of a blue-light-emitting polymer, poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene), was achieved by the addition of 5-10 nm gold nanoparticles. The optical absorption band of the gold nanoparticles was tuned to resonate the triplet exciton ground state bandgap energy of the polymer. Photo-oxidation rate of poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) was effectively reduced by doping the polymer with very small amounts (approximate to10(-6)-10(-5) volume fraction) of the gold nanoparticles.\", \"In this work several symmetrical indolenine squaraine dyes with different groups positioned on the four-membered central ring, such as sulfur, barbituric acid, amino and methylamino, were synthesized, and their structures were fully characterized. All dyes displayed intense and narrow absorption bands in the visible region. To evaluate their singlet oxygen formation ability, the 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran assay was used. The degradation of these squaraine dyes upon light exposure was evaluated in order to infer about their photostability. The in vitro potential of these compounds as photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy was evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay in several tumor (Caco-2, MCF-7 and PC-3) and non-tumor (NHDF and N27) cell lines, using a custom-built LED based light exposure system emitting radiation with the central wavelength close to the maximum absorption wavelength of the squaraine dyes. The indolenine squaraine dyes showed a high ability to produce singlet oxygen and good photostability. The zwit-terionic dyes, namely the unsubstituted dye, the barbituric acid derivative and the monothiosquaraine dye, showed relevant photodynamic activity. It was noteworthy that the unsubstituted squaraine dye exhibited a cytotoxic selectivity for the Caco-2 tumor cell line when compared to the NHDF normal cell line.\", \"The advantages of a polyurethane matrix over other polymers, which are widely used as active media for dye lasers, are analysed. This matrix exhibits the photostability, service life, radiation resistance, conversion efficiency, and homogeneity of the dye distribution that surpass these properties for active media based on polyurethane acrylate, which has close physical and operation properties. These advantages result not only from the milder polymerisation conditions but also from a lower probability of the formation of ion pairs and dye aggregates. A substantial suppression of these processes in polyurethane is explained by its greater polarity and solvation ability compared to polyurethane acrylate.\", \"Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoprobes show promising potential for biosensing and bioimaging applications due to advantageous features of ultrahigh sensitivity and specificity. However, very limited research has been reported on the SERS photostability of nanoprobes upon continuous laser irradiation, which is critical for high-speed and time-lapse microscopy. The core-shell off-resonant gap-enhanced Raman tags (GERTs) with built-in Raman reporters, excited at near-infrared (NIR) region but with a plasmon resonance at visible region, allow decoupling the plasmon resonance behaviors with the SERS performance and therefore show ultrahigh Raman photostability during continuous laser irradiation. In this work, we have synthesized five types of off-resonant GERTs with different embedded Raman reporters, numbers of shell layer, or nanoparticle shapes. Via thorough examination of time-resolved SERS trajectories and quantitative analysis of photobleaching behaviors, we have demonstrated that double metallic-shell GERTs embedded with 1,4-benzenedithiol molecules show the best photostability performance, to the best of our knowledge, among all SERS nanoprobes reported before, with a photobleaching time constant up to 4.8 x 10(5) under a laser power density of 4.7 x 10(5) W cm(-2). Numerical calculations additionally support that the local plasmonic heating effect in fact can be greatly minimized using the off-resonance strategy. Moreover, double-shell BDT-GERTs are highly potential for high-speed and high-resolution Raman-based cell bioimaging.\", \"The main focus of this study was to investigate spectroscopic properties, stoichiometric ratios, physicochemical parameters, polarity and photostability behaviors of newly synthesized chalcone dye in organized media. The chalcone dye, 1-(2,5-Dimethyl-thiophen-3-yl)-3-(9-etnyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-propenone (DTEP), was prepared by the reaction of carbazole aldehyde with 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethythiophene. Data obtained from FT-IR, H-1-NMR, C-13-NMR and elemental analysis were consistent with chemical structure of newly prepared DTEP. Increases in fluorescence intensities of DTEP with cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) were observed. In comparison of fluorescence intensities for DTEP with CTAB, reductions in fluorescence intensities for DTEP with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were noticed under the same experimental and instrumental conditions. Additionally, Benesi-Hildebrand method was applied to determine stoichiometric ratios and association constants of DTEP with CTAB and SDS. Stern-Volmer plot was used in order to further confirm the stoichiometric ratio and association constant of DTEP with SDS. Physicochemical parameters such as singlet absorption, molar absorptivity, oscillator strength, dipole moment and fluorescence quantum yield of DTEP were also determined. Fluorescence polarity study displayed that DTEP was sensitive to the polarity of the microenvironment provided by different solvents.

In addition, the proposed ZnO-AgCl also exhibited an excellent photostability.\", \"Spectral and photophysical properties of several phenalenone dyes were investigated in dependence on the type of polyurethane polymer matrix. The increase in polarity of the solid-state medium was shown to shift absorption and luminescence to the low energy side. Structural effects of the substituents in the phenalenone chromophore on the Stokes shift value were studied.

Water contact angle (CA) measurements indicated the films to be hydrophilic with reduced solid/liquid interfacial surface energy upon metal doping. The films were highly transparent (>94%) with red or blue shift in the absorption edge depending on the dopant type (Ag or Al) owing to the Burstein-Moss effect. The ZnO:Ag and ZnO:Al films with 0.5 and 1.0 wt.% metal dopant showed high degradation efficiency in methylene blue (MB) solution under UV irradiation, mainly due to an increase in the photogenerated electron-hole pair recombination time and hydroxyl radicals (Greek ano teleiaOH) generation. The MB degradation followed pseudo-first-order reaction with maximum apparent reaction rate constant of 2.40 h(-1) for the 0.5 wt.% ZnO:Al film. ZnO films with 1.0 wt.% dopant demonstrated excellent photostability and recyclability even after several runs presumably due to reduced Zn2+ dissolution as well as blocking of the active surface area. ZnO:(Ag + Al) film containing 0.5 wt.% Al and Ag showed excellent UV photodegradation of MB and rhodamine blue (RhB) with high levels of photostability over five cycles.\", \"Photoinstability such as negative-bias-illumination-stress (NBIS) has been a longstanding obstacle in the achievement of low-manufacturing-cost, high-resolution displays and completely transparent devices.

The kinetic parameters of dissociation were determined. Schemes of the reaction mechanism were proposed. The row of photostability of Mg complexes is established. It was shown that the increasing of macrocycle electron-donor properties decreases the stability of the complex, and the decreasing of electronic density increases photostability. It was shown that the bulky substitutents decrease the thermostability of molecule; the fluorine atoms in macrocycle increase thermostability of the compounds.\", \"In this article the design and characterization of a set of novel red-light-emitting laser aza-BODIPY dyes is reported. The applied synthetic method allows an exhaustive and versatile functionalization of both the dipyrrin core and the boron bridge. From the analysis of the photophysical and laser signatures, we determine the suitable modifications of the chromophoric backbone necessary to modulate the emission spectral region, efficiency and photostability under a strong irradiation regime. These dyes are endowed with efficient fluorescence and laser emission, and are particularly outstanding in terms of their high photostability, a key parameter to guarantee long-lasting emission in any (bio)technological application. The herein-reported results support, for the first time, the viability of aza-BODIPYs as tunable red laser dyes. In fact, the laser performances of some of the tested aza-BODIPYs surpass those of commercially available laser dyes in the same spectral region.\", \"A liquid chromatographic method with UV detection (HPLC-DAD) and a gas chromatographic method coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) have been developed for the determination of guaiazulene (CA) in complex matrices such as creams and toothpastes.

For CC-MS analyses, solid-liquid extraction (creams) and SPE (toothpastes) were applied. The proposed methods, based on techniques with different selectivity, were validated and both proved to be suitable to obtain an unambiguous identification and reliable determination of GA in commercial health care products (creams and toothpastes), giving concordant results.

We focused on this filter in the light of the Cosmetics Europe opinion concerning its possible effects on the thyroid gland. Microspheres were prepared by emulsification-solvent evaporation, using different amounts of 4-MBC and characterized for morphology, encapsulation efficiency and particle size. The particles were then mixed in O/W emulsions. The in vitro sun protection factors, in vitro release and photostability were investigated and compared with emulsions containing the free sunscreen. The new microspheres offer good morphology and loading (up to 40%), and the same photoprotection as the free filter while at the same time protecting it from photodegradation. The systems also give a slower release from the emulsions.\", \"Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorod arrays were successfully assembled on the wood surface in situ via a two-step process consisting of formation of ZnO seeds and subsequent crystal growth under hydrothermal conditions at a low temperature. The morphology and crystalline structure of the formed ZnO nanorods were studied by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Highly dense and uniform arrays of ZnO nanorods with well-defined hexagonal facets were generated on the wood surface by tuning the concentration of the ZnO growth solution during the hydrothermal treatment. Accelerated weathering tests indicated that the assembled ZnO nanorod arrays were highly protective against UV radiation and greatly enhanced the photostability of the coated wood. Meanwhile, the ZnO nanorod-coated wood can withstand continuous exposure to flame with only minor smoldering in contrast with the pristine wood catching fire easily and burning rapidly. Moreover, when further modified with low-surface-energy stearic acid, the ZnO nanorod decorated wood surface can be transformed into a superhydrophobic surface, with a water contact angle (CA) of similar to 154. Such ZnO nanorod-modified woods with enhanced photostability, flame retardancy and water repellency offer an interesting alternative to conventional wood preservation strategies, highlighting their potential applications in some novel wood products.

Avobenzone-HPCD complexation was demonstrated by differential scanning calorimetry. Formulations containing 0.12 mg/ml avobenzone and up to 30% (w/w) HPCD were prepared. Transdermal penetration was conducted using a modified Franz diffusion cell apparatus. As the concentration of HPCD was increased from 0% to 20%, transdermal permeation increased. Maximum flux occurred at 20% HPCD, where sufficient cyclodextrin was present to completely solubilize all avobenzone. When the concentration of HPCD was increased to 30%, transdermal penetration decreased, suggesting the formation of an avobenzone reservoir on the skin surface. Photostability of avobenzone was investigated under 100, 250, and 500 kJ/m(2) UVA irradiation. The 30% HPCD formulation was the most photostable, followed by 20%, 10%, and 0% formulations. In vivo, the 30% HPCD formulation afforded the best photoprotection, as evidenced by the lowest extent of sunburn cell formation and edema induction. This work indicates that inclusion of HPCD in sunscreen formulations may enhance photoprotection by reducing both skin penetration and photodecomposition of UV absorbers. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

These photosensitizers show improved photostability against singlet oxygen, when compared to a BODIPY photosensitizer lacking the acetoxymethyl group. Both compounds were evaluated for photodynamic therapy against HeLa cells and photodynamic inactivation against E. coli bacteria. We show that the compounds readily embed in the lipid membranes of HeLa cervical cancer cells and efficiently induced light-dependent apoptosis at nanomolar concentration.

Silica-coated CdSe QDs were made in water-in-oil microemulsion, while amino groups were introduced synchronously onto the nanoparticles by copolymerization of 3-aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane and tetraethyl orthosilicate. The results of TEM imaging, fluorescent spectroscopy and photostability tests show that the QDs are of uniform spherical size (200 +/- 8 nm), monodispersity, and high fluorescence and photostability.\", \"By linking 7-(diethylamino)coumarin and different aromatic groups via an oxazole moiety, a small series of new environment-sensitive fluorophores have been synthesized. They display varying degrees of environment-sensitivity, depending on the aromatic group present on the oxazole ring. Additionally, these coumarin-based fluorophores show considerably better photostability compared to the nitrobenzoxadiazole fluorophore, and offer a good starting point for the further development of these fluorophores into environment-sensitive membrane probes or for other applications requiring sensitivity to the environment.

In 2002, Testing guidances were issued by the regulatory authorities in the USA (2003) and Europe (2002). A key requirement is to measure the absorption of UV-visible light by a compound in the 290-700 nm range and to assess photostability. Further photosafety evaluation is recommended for molecules which absorb light energy in this region and may be unstable in light. Consequently, the current guidances do not specify what constitutes a significant level of light absorbance or photoinstability. The current study was undertaken to determine the level of light absorption by measuring the molar extinction coefficients (MEC) of a wide range of compounds reported in the literature to have known photosafety issues in humans. The results have shown that all compounds tested have absorbance intensities significantly above an MEC threshold of 1000 L mol(-1) cm(-1) and also display a wide range of photoinstability. The measurement of light absorption is a contributing part of an overall pre-clinical photosafety risk assessment process, whereas photostability assessments have proven to have limited value. Molecules with an MEC less than 1000 L mol(-1) cm(-1) are deemed less of a photosafety risk since this low level of light absorption is unlikely to prove harmful.

In the past five years alone, more than hundreds of NFAs with applications in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have been synthesized, enabling a notable current record efficiency of above 15%. Hence, there is a shift in interest toward the use of NFAs in OPVs. However, there has been little work on the stability of these new materials in devices. More importantly, there is very little comparative work on the photostability of FA versus NFA solar cells to ascertain the pros and cons of the two systems. Here, we show the photostability of solar cells based on two workhorse acceptors, in both conventional and inverted structures, namely, ITIC (as NFA) and [70]PCBM (as FA), blended with either PBDB-T or PTB7-Th polymer. We found that, irrespective of the polymer, the cell structure, or the initial efficiency, the [70]PCBM devices are more photostable than the ITIC ones. This observation, however, opposes the assumption that NFA solar cells are more photochemically stable. These findings suggest that complementary absorption should not take precedence in the design rules for the synthesis of new molecules and there is still work left to be done to achieve stable and efficient OSCs.\", \"The aim of this study was to prepare and to evaluate the physicochemical and in vitro drug release characteristics of different nanostructured systems containing clobetasol propionate (CP): CP-loaded polymeric nanoparticles (nanocapsules and nanospheres) and CP-loaded nanoemulsion. Physicochemical characteristics of the formulations were monitored up to 9 months after preparation by means of drug content, encapsulation efficiency, mean size, polydispersity index, pH, and zeta potential. In vitro drug release studies were carried out using the dialysis bag method. Photostability of CP-loaded nanoparticles was evaluated by their exposition to UVA radiation. All formulations presented nanometric mean size (140-220 nm), polydispersity index below 0.25, neutral pH values, negative zeta potential and encapsulation efficiency close to 100%. All these parameters, except pH, remained unchangeable up to 9 months of storage at room temperature for CP-loaded nanocapsules. On the other hand, CP-loaded nanospheres and nanoemulsion showed an increase in their mean size, as well as in polydispersity index under storage (after 3 and 6 months, respectively). In vitro drug release studies showed a controlled release of CP from nanoparticles (nanocapsules > nanospheres > nanoemulsion) with a low burst release. Photostability of CP under UVA radiation was improved by its incorporation into nanoparticles (nanocapsules > nanoemulsions > nanospheres).\", \"Polymer solar cells have a promising future for applications in our day to day usage of energy in small appliances and portable devices. However, their performance in terms of efficiency is limited by a number of factors, among which is their low open circuit voltage (V-oc). It is, therefore, understandable that much effort is channeled by the scientific community in improving the V-oc. One way to achieve this goal is the development of novel materials, for example, polymers, through chemical structure modification. Typical examples are addition (chlorination, fluorination, or sulfonylation) and/or reduction (from alkyl-ester to ketone substituents) mechanisms. This paper reports on the study of the effect of these structural changes for V-oc enhancement on the performance of the polymers in polymer:fullerene solar cells. In particular, it looks at seven polymers of the polybenzodithiophene-thienothiophene family, identifying the structural changes in the thienothiophene units or their moieties as a function of V-oc behavior in relation to their UV-stability. The findings reveal that the fluorination of the TT-units or having alkyl-ester groups as substituents on the TT-units is bad for photostability. However, when these alkyl-ester groups are reduced into ketone substituents, the photostability behavior improves.\", \"The photostability of fluorescent labels comprises one of the main limitations in single-molecule fluorescence (SMF) and super-resolution imaging. An attractive strategy to increase the photostability of organic fluorophores relies on their coupling to photostabilizers, e.g., triplet excited state quenchers, rendering self-healing dyes. Herein we report the self-healing properties of trisNTA-Alexa647 fluorophores (NTA, N-nitrilotriacetic acid). Primarily designed to specifically label biomolecules containing an oligohistidine tag, we hypothesized that the increased effective concentration of Ni(II) triplet state quenchers would lead to their improved photostability. We evaluated photon output, survival time, and photon count rate of different Alexa647-labeled trisNTA constructs differing in the length and rigidity of the fluorophore-trisNTA linker. Maximum photon output enhancements of 25-fold versus Alexa647-DNA were recorded for a short tetraproline linker, superseding the solution based photostabilization by Ni(II). Steady-state and time-resolved studies illustrate that trisNTA self-healing role is associated with a dynamic excited triplet state quenching by Ni(II). Here improved photophysical/photochemical properties require for a judicious choice of linker length and rigidity, and in turn a balance between rapid dynamic triplet excited state quenching versus dynamic/static singlet excited state quenching. TrisNTA fluorophores offer superior properties for SMF allowing specific labeling and increased photostability, making them ideal candidates for extended single-molecule imaging techniques.\", \"Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine if electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy could be used to develop a quick method to predict the longer-term photostability characteristics of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for use in the early development phase.\\nMaterials and methods: EPR spectroscopy was used to study the photodegradation of nearly fifty different APIs in the solid state.\\nResults: Free radical formation was detected in all but three of the APIs studied and singlet oxygen formation was also detected in the presence of five of the APIs tested. The extent of free radical formation in each API after 10 minutes exposed to light was used to rank the APIs in terms of their stability characteristics and determine the probable risk of photodegradation of the API during International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) compliant photostability testing. A correlation was obtained between the extent of free radical formation on exposure to light and the known level of photodegradation products formed during ICH compliant testing.\\nConclusions: The EPR methods were shown to have the potential to predict the ICH level of photodegradation for an API in the solid state using only a small amount of sample and after just 10 minutes exposed to light. This testing can be performed in a shorter time frame than ICH compliant testing and can potentially be used early in development to predict the photostability characteristics of an API.\", \"Colloidal lead halide perovskite nanocrystals and nanoplatelets have emerged as promising semiconductor nanomaterials because of their spectral tunability, facile processability, and bright emission with high color purity. In particular, strong quantum and dielectric confinement make atomically thin colloidal lead bromide perovskite nano platelets a favorable candidate for next-generation deep-blue emitting (lambda(max) = 437 nm) materials. However, poor photostability poses a critical challenge; colloidal nano platelets suffer from photobleaching or transformation into thicker, less-confined nanostructures with red-shifted emission upon UV irradiation. In this study, we synthesize deep-blue emitting organic inorganic hybrid perovskite nanoplatelets (formula: L-2[ABX(3)]BX4, L: butylammonium and octylammonium, A: methylammonium or formamidinium, B: lead, and X: bromide or iodide) with large lateral dimension (similar to 1 mu m) by ligand-assisted reprecipitation and systematically investigate the factors that affect the photostability of those nanoplatelets. We find that freshness of the prepared precursor solutions for ligand-assisted reprecipitation is critical to obtain better stability with high photoluminescence quantum yield of perovskite nanoplatelets. Photobleaching is found to result from intrinsic instability of the perovskite lattice against UV irradiation in nanoplatelets, whereas transformation into thicker nanostructures results from extrinsic factors-moisture, primarily. Furthermore, we observe that substitution of the organic cation from formamidinium to methylammonium and addition of excess alkylammonium bromide ligands significantly enhance both the ambient and photostability. Lastly, we demonstrate that the dropcast film of methylammonium lead bromide nanoplatelets with excess alkylammonium bromide ligands shows dramatically improved stability both under UV irradiation and under ambient conditions. This study expands our understanding of the factors that affect perovskite nanoplatelet photostability and opens up new possibilities for the fabrication of stable perovskite nanoplatelet-based optoelectronic devices.\", \"The aim of this work is to determine the photostability biocompatibility and efficiency of water soluble bio-based substances (SBO) in photo-oxidative processes for wastewater treatment. Three batches of SBO, isolated from different sources, have been investigated. Differences in the functional groups present in these substances can explain major trends in their physical/chemical properties. Bioassays have proven those materials to be non-toxic but to show poor biodegradability. Their ability to enhance a photo-Fenton process at milder pH (5.2) has been investigated using a mixture of emerging compounds in wastewaters. All the tested SBO were able to remove all pollutants in less than one hour irradiation, and the best results were obtained with those substances showing higher hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio. Moreover, although SBOs themselves undergo a slight oxidation, no relevant negative effect has been observed for their use in wastewater treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The degree of photodegradation depends on the nature of dye and the amount of absorber applied to the silk. The addition of the UV-absorber resulted in a slight decrease in dye uptake and the addition of 2% owf salicylic acid benzyl ester afforded a good deal of protection against photodegradation.

The effects of various reaction parameters on the properties of the benzoylated wood were investigated. The weight percentage gain (WPG) was arranged from 29.6% to 118.1%. The physicochemical properties of the benzoylated wood were characterized by FT-IR, solid-state CP/MAS C-13 NMR, solution-state H-1 and C-13 NMR, TGA/DTG, as well as artificial accelerated weathering. The results confirmed that the homogeneous benzoylation was successfully conducted and highly benzoylated wood derivatives could be obtained in this novel system. The thermal stability of the benzoylated wood was increased while the WPG value above 40.0% and decreased with a low WPG value. The wood meal became more hydrophobic after benzoylation. A linear relationship between the WPG value and the photostability of the benzoylated wood prepared in the ionic liquid system was observed for the first time. Benzoylation of wood to high weight gains was effective at protecting wood from photodegradation. All of these improved properties make it beneficial for photostable green composites production.

The \\\"push-pull\\\" electronic effect caused by the methyl groups at 3 and 5 positions is a significant positive factor to the high quantum yields of 2. The X-ray structure analysis of 1c and 2c reveals that steric expulsion exists between the phenyl and adjacent two methyl groups.

We investigated the dependence of photostability of terrylene diimide (TDI) derivative on its environment using confocal fluorescence microscopy. Seven different polymers were tested. Depending on the matrix, photo-bleaching quantum yields vary by 2 orders of magnitude. Their values correlate with parameters characterizing oxygen mobility in polymers: diffusion coefficient and permeability. Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) exhibit the lowest photodestruction quantum yields. Additional enhancement of photostability can be achieved by aging of PVC or by flushing the sample with nitrogen, which confirms the involvement of oxygen in photodestruction. Different character of the time traces of the intensity of emission from single TDI molecules is observed for different polymer matrices, ranging from intense blinking in the least stable polycarbonate, to practically no blinking in the most stable PVC. These results suggest a photodegradation mechanism involving self-sensitized photoxidation in oxygen complexes of TDI.\", \"A convenient method for measuring the clean colour (Y and Y-Z) and photostability Delta(Y-Z) of small samples of fleece wool (0.5 g) is described. Scoured wool samples are compressed to a constant density in disposable polymethyl methacrylate spectrophotometer cells and the wool colour is measured using a standard textile laboratory reflectance spectrophotometer. Packing scoured wool into cells ensures that the irradiated fibre surface is robust and individual fibres are unable to move relative to one another during irradiation and measurement. A UVB (280-320 nm) source was used to ensure all samples regardless of initial yellowness were yellowed following exposure and photobleaching was avoided. An apparatus capable of irradiating up to 48 scoured wool samples in one batch is described. The precision of photostability measurements was assessed and the relative error in Delta(Y-Z) was 5.7%. An initial study on 75 fleece wool samples with a high range of initial yellowness showed a moderate linear correlation (R(2) = 0.68) between initial yellowness and Delta(Y-Z).\", \"Three new photostable rylene dyes for applications in single molecule studies and membrane labelling have been synthesized and their photophysical properties were characterized. These dyes differ in the number of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains attached to the core structure which is either a perylene derivate or a terrylene derivate. One perylene and one terrylene dye is modified with two PEG chains, and another terrylene derivate has four PEG chains. The results show that the terrylene dye with four PEG chains (4-PEG-TDI) forms soluble nonfluorescing H-aggregates in water, so that the absorption bands are blue-shifted with respect to those of the fluorescing monomeric form. The presence of a surfactant such as Pluronic P123 leads to the disruption of the aggregates due to the formation of monomers in micelles and a strong increase in fluorescence. Application for labelling cell membranes can be considered for this dye since it adsorbs in a similar way as monomer to a lipid bilayer. Furthermore a single-molecule study of all three rylene dyes in polymeric films of PMMA showed excellent photostability with respect to photobleaching, far above the photostability of other common water-soluble dyes, such as Oxazine-1, Atto647N, Cy5, Alexa647 and Rhodamin6G. Especially 4-PEG-TDI seems to be a promising dye for membrane labelling with its high photostability.\", \"The photostability of three types of furosemide (FUR) cocrystal (FUR-caffeine, FUR-urea, and FUR-nicotinamide cocrystals) was studied under irradiation with a D65 fluorescent lamp. The coloration of the FUR-urea pellets was significantly faster than that of the intact FUR, whereas the coloration of FUR-nicotinamide was suppressed compared with that of intact FUR and the other cocrystals. In the case of FUR-urea, the chemical degradation of FUR increased by approximately 6.6% after irradiation for 90d. On the other hand, FUR-nicotinamide showed better chemical stability, with only 1.3% of FUR degraded, which was significantly lower than the other cocrystals. The FUR-urea pellets showed a UV-Visible absorption spectrum similar to that of intact FUR, while the absorption range of FUR-nicotinamide shifted to a shorter wavelength. The light sensitivity of FUR-nicotinamide was improved because of the much lower emission of the D65 fluorescent lamp in the absorption range of the cocrystal.\", \"Nerolidol, a naturally occurring sesquiterpene with antimicrobial activities, is a promising candidate as a natural alternative for synthetic preservatives in food. However, its application is limited by low aqueous solubility and stability. In this study, conventional liposomes and drug-in-cyclodextrin-in-liposomes (DCLs) were evaluated for the first time as encapsulating materials for nerolidol. The size, encapsulation efficiency (EE%), loading rate (LR%), photo-and storage stabilities of both systems were characterized. Moreover, the in vitro release of nerolidol from liposomes and DCLs was investigated over time. Nerolidol was efficiently entrapped in both carriers with high EE% and LR% values. In addition, DCLs prolonged the release of nerolidol over one week and enhanced the photostability more effectively than conventional liposomes. Finally, all formulations were stable after 12 months of storage at 4 degrees C (> 60% incorporated nerolidol). Therefore, DCLs are promising carriers for new applications of sesquiterpenes in the pharmaceutical and food industries.\", \"The effect of the incorporation of ethylene on the photostability of isotactic poly(propylene) (iPP) was studied with the aim of improving the photostability. iPP was prepared with a random ethylene sequence (ethylene-propylene random copolymer, rPP), and the photooxidative degradation behavior was compared with that of homogeneous iPP Both samples were thermally post-treated under vacuum to ensure the same crystallinity. The degradation behavior was studied by infrared spectroscopy (IR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and temperature rising elution fractionation (TREF) measurements. The rates of hydroperoxide and carbonyl formation in the irradiated iPP increased with irradiation time for > 192 h, whereas those in the irradiated rPP are almost constant after 96 h. The change in molecular weight with the irradiation time showed similar behavior, suggesting that the degradation reaction in the irradiated rPP was suppressed after 96 h. The degradation behavior of rPP was thought to be due to the dissociation of the methyl group, which leads to the termination of degradation.

RP was incorporated into PCOs at levels of 0.04%, 0.1% and 1% (w/w). PCOs efficiently protected RP from UVA-mediated degradation. Over 75% RP-activity remained in PCOs after 4 days of UVA irradiation, while 12% RP-activity remained in soybean oil. HPLC analysis showed that cis-RP was formed in liquid soybean oil after 2 days of UVA irradiation while it was absent in PCOs matrices. PCOs blocked the energy absorption from UVA and further dampened the UVA-mediated ionic photodissociation and free radical reaction due to matrix immobilization. For all samples, RP photodegradation followed a 2nd order reaction. From the reaction kinetics, it would be possible to predict the RP photodegradation rate in PCO matrices. PCOs were shown to be a promising matrix to protect RP from photodegradation.\", \"We previously reported that constrained 2-phenylbenzo[b]phosphole P-oxides bearing a diphenylamino group show high photostability and thus are promising dyes for fluorescence imaging. Herein we investigated the impact of the bridging moieties on their photophysical properties. A series of benzo[b]phosphole P-oxides constrained with various carbon or silicon bridges were synthesized. All of these compounds showed significant solvatochromism in fluorescence due to the intramolecular charge-transfer character in the excited state. The dipole moments in the excited state for the carbon-bridged derivatives are slightly larger than the silicon-bridged counterparts. Nevertheless, the latter compounds showed orange-red fluorescence in polar solvents with ca. 30 nm red-shifted maxima compared to the carbon analogues. Most importantly, the assessment of their photobleaching resistance revealed that the photostability of this compound series highly relies on the steric bulkiness of the bridging moiety, and even the silicon-bridged derivative can show outstanding photostability, as far as the silicon-bridging moiety has sufficient bulkiness.\", \"The aim of this study was to develop photostable gastro retentive formulation for nifedipine loading into low-density polypropylene microporous particles (Accurel MP 1000 (R)) by a solvent evaporation technique using the 3(2) factorial design.

Optimized microparticles formulated into a capsule were evaluated for the dissolution study and compared with marketed formulation. Higher values of T-50%, time required for 50% degradation of drug with threefold and 1.5-fold decrease in degradation rate constant (K) under UV and fluorescent lamp were observed for the microparticles, respectively, as compared to pure nifedipine indicated remarkable improved photostability.

In this study, we performed photo oxidation studies on DTS(FBTTh2)(2):fullerene bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) films, one of the promising small molecule materials for OPV cells, by using two-dimensional (2D) grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), absorption spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of 2D-GIWAXS and absorption spectroscopic analyses indicate that increasing the crystallinity of DTS(FBTTh2)(2): fullerene BHJ films improved their photostability. The AFM results suggest that the roughness of the original DTS(FBTTh2)(2):fullerene films was also related to their photooxidation rates. The results obtained in this work show that changing the fullerene derivative species and controlling the nanostructures of the thin films are both important criteria for improving the photostability of OPV cells.

The effect of oxygen on the photo-instability was also determined. Avobenzone was found to lose absorption efficacy as a result of photoisomerisation from the enol to the keto form and/or photodegradation to form photoproducts that absorb principally in the UVC region. depending on the solvent. It was found to be essentially photostable in the polar protic solvent methanol but photoisomerised in the polar aprotic solvent dimethylsulfoxide. In the nonpolar solvent cyclohexane. it photodegraded appreciably. Both photoisomerisation and photodegradation occurred to a similar extent in the moderately polar aprotic solvent ethyl acetate. Photoisomerisation occurred only in the presence of oxygen whereas photodegradation occurred irrespective of oxygen. This knowledge is important in order to achieve the correct formulation for sunscreens incorporating avobenzone. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we replaced the methylene bridge with another P=O group to 1)investigate the role of the bridging moieties; and 2)further modulate the fluorescence properties of this skeleton. We synthesized a series of phospholo[3,2-b]phosphole-based dyestrans-PO-PB430, cis-PO-PB430, and trans-PO-PB460all of which showed sufficient water solubility. Moreover, trans-PO-PB430 and trans-PO-PB460 exhibited intense green and orange fluorescence, respectively, and a high photostability that was comparable to that of PB430. In contrast, cis-PO-PB430 underwent rapid photobleaching upon continuous photoirradiation, which demonstrated the importance of steric shielding of the polycyclic skeleton by the substituents on the bridging moieties. The fluorescence properties of these dyes were insensitive to concentration, pH value, and polarity changes of the environment in solution. In addition, even in the solid state, these dyes showed strong green to orange emissions. These results demonstrate the potential utility of trans-PO-PB430 and trans-PO-PB460 as highly photostable fluorescent dyes.\", \"Ag/ZnO photocatalysts with different Ag loadings were prepared by photocatalytic reduction of Ag+ on ZnO with ethanol as hole scavenger. It was found that loading an appropriate amount of Ag on ZnO not only enhances its photocatalytic activity, but also improves its photostability. The Ag/ZnO photocatalysts were characterized with XRD, BET, DRUV-vis, Raman, PL, and photoelectrochemical measurement. No matter what the Ag loading is higher or low, silver exists in the form of metallic species in the Ag/ZnO photocatalysts. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity is due to the fact that the modification of ZnO with an appropriate amount of Ag can increase the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes in ZnO, and the improvement of photostability of ZnO is attributed to a considerable decrease of the surface defect sites of ZnO after the Ag loading. The chemisorption of molecular oxygen and the chemisorption of atomic oxygen on Ag in the Ag/ZnO photocatalysts were observed. It was found that the metallic Ag in the Ag/ZnO photocatalysts does play a new role of O-2 chemisorption sites except for electron acceptor, by which chemisorbed molecular oxygen reacts with photogenerated electrons to form active oxygen species, and thus facilitates the trapping of photogenerated electrons and further improves the photocatalytic activity of the Ag/ZnO photocatalysts.

Photophysical studies were performed in dry ethanol and aqueous solutions. The terminals at the 5-amino position were found to influence the acid-base equilibrium. The presence of hydroxyl functionality at 2-position was found to introduce an additional basic form that is the one in equilibrium with the cationic acid form in dry ethanol solutions. The photostability of these compounds in different media was also investigated and a high resistance to photobleaching in model biological membranes was observed. In proteins a moderate of 20% photobleaching occurs in 1 h 30 min, while in water more than 60% of the compound molecules are photodegraded during the same time interval. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the spin-exchange interaction between KN and nitroxide moieties, the triplet lifetimes in such conjugates are much shorter than in KN molecule, but the triplet quantum yields are significantly higher. The reaction of intramolecular electron transfer between photoexcited KN and nitroxide moieties is the main factor determining the quantum yield of KN-RNO center dot conjugates photodecomposition. Searching for a method to suppress this side process we synthesized analogues of previously prepared conjugates with the enlarged spacer between the nitroxide and kynurenine parts and with the sterically hindered access to the nitroxide group. The new spin-labeled kynurenines showed at least three-fold higher photostability compared to the previously synthesized compounds of this type. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, the photophysics and photostability of a highly fluorescent 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl) anthracene derivative (G) and its self-assembled boronic ester encapsulation complex (G@Cap) embedded in a glassy polymer matrix are investigated by single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy (SMFS). The heterogeneity of the fluorescence emission wavelength and triplet blinking kinetics of the guest G are significantly decreased by supramolecular encapsulation due to conformational restriction and reduced heterogeneity in the local environment. A nearly 10-fold increase in the photostability of G due to encapsulation is quantitatively confirmed by evaluating the photobleaching yields of G and G@Cap. In addition, it is found that the G@Cap is > 30-fold more photostable than rhodamine 6G, a widely used fluorescent dye in single-molecule studies. These results demonstrate that the G@Cap can serve as a very bright, long-lasting fluorescent probe for single-molecule studies.\", \"Phospholipid quantum dot micelles are useful for bio-applications because of their amphiphilicity and exceptional biocompatibilities. We investigated the uptake of phospholipid [polyethylene glycol (PEG), biotin, and folic acid terminated] modified CdSe/ZnS quantum dot micelles by cancer cells and its photostability under ultrviolet light in the C spectrum (UV-C) (254 nm) or UV-A (365 nm) light irradiation. The stability of micelles to the exposure of UV-C and UV-A light was assessed. Biotin-modified quantum dot micelles give photoluminescence enhancement under UV-C light irradiation. Folate modified micelle under UV-C and UV-A results show considerable photoluminescence enhancement. Photoluminescence lifetime measurements showed 7.04, 8.11 and 11.42 ns for PEG, folate, and biotin terminated phospholipid micelles, respectively. Folate and biotin-modified quantum dot micelles showed excellent uptake by HeLa cells under fluorescence confocal microscopy. Phospholipid CdSe/ZnS quantum dot micelles can be potentially used for diagnosis and treatment of cancer in the future.\", \"The aim of this study was to prepare solid lipid microspheres (SLM) of octyl methoxy cinnamate (2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxy cinnamate; OMC) to achieve controlled release, decrease penetration of this UV absorber from skin and improve its photostability. The influence of the carrier on the rate of release was studied in vitro with a cellulose acetate membrane and in vivo from excised rat skin with Franz diffusion cells. The release rate was decreased by up to 13-80% with the SLM formulation. In vivo, penetration of OMC into skin was investigated by HPLC method. It was found out that the rate of penetration is significantly dependent upon the formulation and could be decreased by up to 77% in SLM formulations. When different topical vehicles were compared, OMC was released and penetrated into rat skin more quickly and in greater amount from vehicles containing free OMC than in SLM form. Additionally, photostability was shown to be improved in SLM form. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, their photostability remains a practical bottleneck and further optimization is highly desirable. Here, we studied the photostability of as-obtained colloidal CsPbI3 QDs suspended in hexane. We found that light illumination does induce photodegradation of CsPbI3 QDs. Steady-state spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and transient absorption spectroscopy verified that light illumination leads to detachment of the capping agent, collapse of the CsPbI3 QD surface, and finally aggregation of surface Pb-0. Both dangling bonds containing surface and Pb-0 serve as trap states causing PL quenching with a dramatic decrease of PL quantum yield. Our work provides a detailed insight about the correlation between the structural and photophysical consequences of the photo-degradation process in CsPbI3 QDs and may lead to the optimization of such QDs toward device applications.\", \"Photo-instability of common UV-filters is a well documented phenomenon. This study develops a method for concomitant measurement of photostability and photo-induced ROS generation in cosmetic formulations. Oil-in-water formulations containing three common UV filters (OMC, BMDBM, EHT), individually or combined, were further supplemented with phosphatidylcholine and exposed to UVA. All filters show spectral decrease after UVA exposure. OMC and EHT do not induce significant lipid-peroxidation (as measured by TBARS production) while BMDBM does. In the latter case, this is reduced when BMDBM is combined with OMC but not with EHT. Neither OMC nor EHT stabilize BMDBM with respect to loss of absorbance. ROS-generation assessed via TBARS formation was supported by EPR experiments. The UV-induced changes in UV-filter performance, as monitored in the model formulations and in commercial sunscreens, demonstrate that this is a simple and effective method for stability assessment of sunscreen filters under conditions of use.\", \"The photostability of various electro-optic active guest-host polymers, doped with chromophores that possess very efficient cyano-containing acceptors and dialkyamino- or diarylamino-benzenes, and also their extended thiophene analogs as bridging structures, has been investigated over a broad wavelength range in the near infrared and the visible. A variation of over 2 orders of magnitude was found in the probability that an absorbed photon will lead to a photodegraded chromophore. The most photostable chromophore contained a tricyanovinyl acceptor and a diarylaminobenzene bridge unit.

In addition, the photooxidative stability of the pi-conjugated binuclear Pc was determined and compared to the stabilities of the mononuclear ZnPc and the known near-infrared photosensitizer, zinc tetra-tert-butylnaphthalocyanine (lambda(max) = 761 nm). The results are explained by DFT calculations and cyclic voltammetry.\", \"The photophysical behaviour of 2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)perimidine (6), which possesses a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond is evidenced as due to the non-transferred enol form. This compound is highly stable to light, with a photodegradative quantum yield in degassed cyclohexane of 7 x 10(-6), suggesting that the involvement of a light-induced excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process in which the phenolic proton is transferred from the enol form to the neighbouring nitrogen atom is less important for conferring photostability than has hitherto been supposed for such type of systems.\", \"Heartwood extracts of Acacia confusa (HEAc) were proven to have the capability of ameliorating wood photostability. However, the efficacy of photostability compared with that of commercial photostabilizers was unknown. The aim of this study was to examine whether HEAc can be used as commercial photostabilizers. Comparison was made among commercially available photostabilizers, UV absorber (Eversorb 80, EV80) and hindered amine light stabilizer (Eversorb 93, EV93). Photostability of wood slices soaked in 1, 5 and 10 % HEAc or 1 % commercial photostabilizers (EV80 or EV93) solutions was evaluated. The discoloration of 5 and 10 % HEAc-treated specimens was significantly reduced after UV irradiation. Furthermore, lignin degradation and carbonyl formation were concurrently inhibited by 5 and 10 % HEAc treatments after UV irradiation. Interestingly, 1 % HEAc treatment showed similar effectiveness compared with EV80 treatment, while 5 and 10 % HEAc treatments showed better effectiveness than EV80 treatment. HEAc can absorb UV light and quench radicals; hence, wood photodegradation was consequently prevented. These results revealed that HEAc has great potential to be developed as a natural photostabilizer.\", \"The long term stability of lemon oil, orange oil, hop oil, and chamomile oil as beta- or gamma-cyclodextrin (CD) inclusion compound was examined. The storage was performed for up to 2 years. Furthermore, examination of the photostability were done.\\nClosed storage of the beta-CD inclusion compounds of lemon oil, orange, and hop oil allowed an almost total avoidance of instabilities with the three included oils. Storage in non-closed containers offers no total safety because of the possible influence of humidity. The fast deterioration of chamazulene in chamomile oil is decelerated by gamma-CD.\\nPhotochemical changes can be avoided or diminished by inclusion formation. This is proven by the diminished formation of p-cymene in the lemon oil/beta-CD inclusion compound, the reduced deterioration of myrcene and the formation of carveol and carvene in the orange oil/beta-CD inclusion compound and the large avoidance of the oxidation of linalool in the hop oil/beta-CD inclusion compound. The increase of photostability of chamomile oil by IJ-CD is low.\", \"Low-molecular-weight organic molecules, such as coumarins and stilbenes, are used commercially as fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs) to mask photoyellowing and to brighten colors in fabrics. FWAs achieve this by radiating extra blue light, thus changing the hue and also adding to the brightness. However, organic FWAs can rapidly photodegrade in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, exacerbating the yellowing process through a reaction involving singlet oxygen species. Inorganic nanoparticles, on the other hand, can provide a similar brightening effect with the added advantage of photostability. We report a targeted approach in designing new inorganic silicon- and germanium-based nanoparticles, functionalized with hydrophilic (amine) surface terminations as novel inorganic FWAs. When applied on wool, by incorporation in a sol-gel Si matrix, the inorganic FWAs improved brightness properties, demonstrated enhanced photostability toward UV radiation, especially the germanium nanoparticles, and also generated considerably lower levels of reactive oxygen species compared to a commercial stilbene-based organic FWA, Uvitex NFW.\", \"Ag3PO4 photocatalyst was prepared by precipitation method and characterized by SEM, XRD and diffusive reflectance UV-vis (DRUV-vis) absorption spectra. The gas-phase photodegradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as benzene and acetone, and the liquid-phase photodegradation of the cationic and anionic dyes on Ag3PO4 were systematically investigated. Both benzene and acetone could not be photodegraded on the Ag3PO4 photocatalyst under the visible irradiation. The Ag3PO4 photocatalyst is efficient for the photodegradation of the aqueous dye solutions, but could not completely photomineralize the dyes to CO2 and H2O. The reason is discussed by comparing the oxidation potential of organic pollutants and the potential of photogenerated holes in Ag3PO4, and measuring the absorption of organic pollutants on Ag3PO4. The photostability of the Ag3PO4 photocatalyst for the photo-degradation of the dyes was tested. The Ag3PO4 photocatalyst itself is photostable in the absence of the scavenger of the photogenerated holes, but is photocatalytically instable in the liquid-phase photodegradation of dyes due to the photoreduction of Ag+ in Ag3PO4 to Ag.

Shells of up to three monolayers in thickness were grown on cores ranging in diameter from 23 to 39 Angstrom. Shell growth was controllable to within a tenth of a monolayer and was consistently accompanied by a red shift of the absorption spectrum, an increase of the room temperature photoluminescence quantum yield (up to at least 50%), and an increase in the photostability. Shell growth was shown to be uniform and epitaxial by the use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and optical spectroscopy. The experimental results indicate that in the excited state the hole is confined to the core and the electron is delocalized throughout the entire structure. The photostability can be explained by the confinement of the hole, while the delocalization of the electron results in a degree of electronic accessibility that makes these nanocrystals attractive for use in optoelectronic devices.\", \"N,N'-biphenyl-N,N'-bis-(3-methylphenyl)-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4,4'-diamine (TPD) and N,N'-biphenyl-N,N'-bis-(1-naphenyl)-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4,4'-diamine (NPB) are typical hole transporting materials, which are widely used in current organic electroluminescence (EL) research. NPB is regarded as a better hole transporting material than TPD, since it has a higher glass transition temperature (T-g). In this paper, the photostability and morphological stability of TPD and NPB have been studied in film states. It is concluded that NPB thin film is a better hole transporting material for organic EL than TPD, not only because it has a higher T-g, but also because it is more photostable and has a better morphological stability in thin film state.

Subsequently, through a simple ion-exchange reaction between the CdS microsphere and Bi(NO3)(3)center dot 5H(2)O, novel urchin-shaped CdS/Bi2S3 core/shell heterostructures have successfully been fabricated. The photocatalytic activity and photostability were evaluated by degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light irradiation. The results show that the content of Bi2S3 had important effects on the photocatalytic activity, and the CdS/Bi2S3 heterostructures with the theoretical molar ratio of Bi/Cd 0.25 exhibited the best photocatalytic activity. The improved photocatalytic activity and photostability were attributed to the visible light absorption enhanced by Bi2S3 and the formation of a heterojunction between CdS and Bi2S3, which can effectively accelerate the charge separation and transfer corrosive holes from CdS to robust Bi2S3. Experimentally and theoretically, Bi2S3 anchored on CdS acts as a corrosion protection agent for CdS and also acts as a co-catalyst.\", \"Micrometer-sized spherical particles containing laser dyes such as Rhodamine 6G, DCM and Pyridine I have been fabricated by the vibrating orifice technique for the spherical cavity micro-laser. A cylindrical liquid jet of diluted hybrid raw materials passing through an orifice breaks up into equal-sized droplets by mechanical vibration. Then the solvent of these droplets was evaporated during flying with carrier gas and subsequently solidified into dye-doped hybrid-microspheres in ammonium water trap. The microspheres of different dye contents were pumped by second harmonic pulses of Q-switched Nd: YAG laser (532 nm wavelength, repetition rate is 10 Hz) and their photodegradation of lasing intensities were measured against shot number of pumping pulses. Degree of the degradation strongly depended on the pumping power and the dye content incorporated in the microsphere. Suitable pumping power and dye content gave the best data for the photostability: Laser out-put energy was consumed 50% of the initial value after 100,000 pulses for R6G and Pyridine 1, and 240,000 pulses for DCM.\", \"Perovskite solar cells typically use TiO2 as charge extracting materials, which reduce the photostability of perovskite solar cells under illumination (including ultraviolet light). Simultaneously realizing the high efficiency and photostability, it is demonstrated that the rationally designed iron(III) oxide nanoisland electrodes consisting of discrete nanoislands in situ growth on the compact underlayer can be used as compatible and excellent electron extraction materials for perovskite solar cells. The uniquely designed iron(III) oxide electron extraction layer satisfies the good light transmittance and sufficient electron extraction ability, resulting in a promising power conversion efficiency of 18.2%. Most importantly, perovskite solar cells fabricated with iron(III) oxide show a significantly improved UV light and long-term operation stabilities compared with the widely used TiO2-based electron extraction material, owing to the low photocatalytic activity of iron(III) oxide. This study highlights the potential of incorporating new charge extraction materials in achieving photostable and high efficiency perovskite photovoltaic devices.\", \"Many novel fluorescent nanomaterials exhibit radically different optical properties compared to organic fluorophores that are still the most extensively used class of fluorophores in biology today. Assessing the practical impact of these optical differences for bioimaging experiments is challenging due to a lack of published quantitative benchmarking data. This study therefore directly and quantitatively compares the brightness and photostability of representatives from seven classes of fluorescent materials in spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy experiments for the first time. These material classes are: organic dyes, semiconductor quantum dots, fluorescent beads, carbon dots, gold nanoclusters, nanodiamonds, and nanorubies. The relative brightness of each material is determined and the minimum material concentrations required to generate sufficient contrast in a fluorescence microscopy image are assessed. The influence of optical filters used for imaging is also discussed and suitable filter combinations are identified. The photostability of all materials is determined under typical imaging conditions and the number of images that can be acquired is inferred. The results are expected to facilitate the transition of novel fluorescent materials from physics and chemistry into biology laboratories.\", \"Acitretin, a retinoid for the treatment of severe psoriasis, exhibits extremely low aqueous solubility and high photosensitivity. This study investigated the effects of the complexation of acitretin with the respective hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) and randomly substituted methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (RMBCD) on the aqueous solubility and photostability of the drug. Phase-Solubility studies indicated that the solubility of acitretin was dramatically improved by formation of complexes and further increased by pH adjustment. Stability constants were much higher for acitretin complexed with RMBCD than with HPBCD. Both cyclodextrins acted to decrease degradation of acitretin in solution. The physicochemical properties of solid inclusion complexes were characterized by. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray diffractometry. Molecular modeling with MMFF94s force field (SYBYL V6.6) was utilized to predict the preferred orientation of acitretin in the cyclodextrin cavity and the main structural features responsible for the enhancement of its solubility and photostability.

Based on the HPLC/MS and UV-Vis analysis the formation of two different chlorinated products (5-chloro-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone and 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone) was established. Identity of chlorinated products was confirmed by means of comparison of retention times with independently synthesized standards. Photostability study showed that dichloro-derivative in water is less stable then parent compounds, which is not the case for monochloro-derivatives. Toxicity of chlorinated compounds tested by Vibrio fischeri was found to be in the same range as that of the starting compounds. Preliminary testing of real water samples from swimming pools and sea swimming areas confirmed the presence of BP3 and its 3,5-dichloro derivative.\", \"The possibility of enhancing the photochromic effect for creating polymer compositions with improved photochromic characteristics (photostability, high photosensitivity, expanded operative wavelength range, and increased darkening intensity) is investigated, and its prospects are discussed.\", \"The organic ligands passivating the surface of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) and the solvents used strongly determine the photostability of QD solutions. Highly purified QD solutions in chloroform have been shown to photodegrade upon pulsed ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, irrespectively of the type of surface ligand. However, the photostability of QDs dissolved in n-octane, a more photochemically inert solvent, strongly depends on the ligands passivating their surface. In n-octane, hexadecylamine-coated QDs are completely stable and display no photochemical response to pulsed UV laser irradiation. In solutions of octanethiol-capped QDs, the photoluminescence intensity slightly decreases under irradiation. QDs coated with trioctylphosphine oxide exhibit a more complex pattern of photobleaching, which depends on the initial value of fluorescence quantum yield of QDs. This complex pattern may be accounted for by two competing processes: (1) ligand photodesorption accompanied by photobleaching due to specific alignment of the band levels of QDs and highest occupied molecular orbital of the ligand and (2) photoinduced decrease in the population of trapping states. Furthermore, practically no thermodynamic degradation of QD solutions has been observed for the micromolar QD concentration used in the study, in contrast to lower concentrations, thus confirming the photoinduced origin of the changes caused by UV irradiation. Obtained results show that the photostability of QDs may be strongly increased by careful selection of the ligands passivating their surface and the solvents used in the experiments.\", \"Melanin/titanium dioxide (TiO2) composite systems are introduced as efficient UV absorbers. Natural melanin particles were extracted from the pigmented alpaca fibers and the spindle-like rutile TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized through a two-step sol-gel method at room temperature. The composites of melanin/TiO2 were prepared via electrostatic attraction force. In order to understand the UV absorption features of melanin and melanin/TiO2 composite systems, the prepared particles were applied to the surface of wool fabrics. Then, the UV protection and photostability of functionalized fabrics were assessed based on photoinduced chemiluminescence (PICL) emission, UV reflectance spectra, photoyellowing and ultraviolet protection factor (UPF). It was observed that the photostability of treated fabrics enhanced significantly, implying the generation of less free polymeric radicals in the substrate under UV irradiation. Among different synthesized composites, the proportion of melanin/TiO2 1/4 was the most efficient ratio inducing 80% reduction in the PICL emission peak intensity compared with untreated wool samples. The presence of melanin particles significantly enhanced the UPF values of fabrics where 30% increment was observed for wool samples after treating with melanin/TiO2 1/4 compared with pure TiO2. Having some advantages such as nontoxicity, eco-friendly and feasible synthesis approach, the prepared bio-organic/inorganic composite structures can be of some potential applications in photoprotecting and free radical quenching purposes.

The single-molecule detection of BPEA was verified by recording fluorescence intensity trajectories, fluorescence lifetimes, and fluorescence spectra. The intensity trajectories showed frequent on/off blinking and one-step photobleaching behaviors. The observed blinking was attributed to the temporary occupation of the excited triplet state T-1 via intersystem crossing (ISC). Assuming a three-state model (e.g., S-0, S-1, and T-1), the distributions of triplet lifetime and S-1 -> T-1 ISC quantum yield of BPEA were both derived from the analyses of the blinking statistics and the intensity autocorrelation. We found extremely low ISC yields (on the order of 10(-5)-10(-4)), which were theoretically rationalized by the large energy gap between B-3(2u) and S-1(B-1(1u))/T-1(B-3(1u)) states. SMS measurements were also conducted under both air and Ar atmospheres in order to gain insight into the influence of oxygen on photobleaching. The results reveal that, although the presence of oxygen considerably degraded the photostability of BPEA, under deoxygenated conditions, BPEA delivers more than 10(7) photons before photobleaching and possesses an appreciably low photobleaching yield of 10(-9)-10(-8). This study shows that BPEA has a relatively high degree of photostability at room temperature and can serve as a useful green fluorescent probe for SMS studies.\", \"Evaluating the stability of drugs over ranges of various environmental conditions is necessary to ensure the quality of the drug throughout the shelf life. In this study, we used indomethacin, which is well known as a photosensitive drug, and evaluated the photostability of prepared crystals. HPLC analysis revealed that all the indomethacin crystals were degraded by light exposure. However, the indomethacin crystals involving solvates had different degrees of photodegradation and different solid-state UV/Vis spectra. The value of the absorption integral in the UVA range related closely to the photodegradation of indomethacin crystals involving solvates. Therefore, it is easy to compare the photosensitivity among the crystals without actual analytical data, by use of a suitable analytical method and using light exposure samples. Moreover, it is possible to predict the value of photodegradation ratio from the solid-state UV/Vis spectra of indomethacin crystals. Therefore, this method may provide key information for selecting the most appropriate crystal form of photosensitive drugs.\", \"The surface treatment of thiol-capped CdTe quantum dots (QDs) was carried out with a small amount of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in aqueous solution at room temperature. The treatment effectively enhanced the photostability of QDs and increased the photoluminescence (PL) efficiency by a factor of two as against the original ones. By measuring the PL trajectories of single QDs with a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope under the same irradiation density of 0.72 mu W mu m(-2) at 532 nm, the photostable lifetimes were determined to be 15.2 +/- 5.9 s for surface-treated QDs, and 5.8 +/- 1.9 s for the original ones, respectively. Both the original and treated QDs could be ingested into human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (QGY) by incubation. The photobleaching of cellular QDs was measured with a confocal microscope. Remarkable enhancement was found for the photostability of the surface-treated QDs in QGY cells, demonstrating its advantage for cellular labelling applications.\", \"We examined the photostability of a double-stranded DNA oligomer, covalently labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 on one strand, in the presence of metallic silver island films. In our experimental configuration a minor fraction of the labeled DNA was close to the silver particles and the remainder was distant from the particles. Proximity of the fluorophores to silver island films resulted in increased intensity. Upon continuous illumination we found a fraction of the emission that was resistant to the photo-bleaching. The emission spectra of the residual fractions were identical to the initial spectra. The frequency-domain lifetime measurements of this fraction revealed greatly shortened decay times. These results are consistent with the photostable fraction being close to the silver particles. This results suggest that the number of photons detected per fluorophore, prior to photobleaching, can be increased 5-fold or more by proximity to silver particles. Localization at an optimal distance from the silver surface may result in larger enhancements.\", \"The photostability of quercetin in alcoholic solutions was studied. Both UVA and UVB light induced degradation of quercetin, yielding a single product 1 deriving from oxidation and addition of an alcohol molecule to the 2,3 double bond. The same mechanism operated when quercetin was dissolved in alkaline solutions, and again a product 2 due to oxidation and addition of water was characterized. Comparison with quercetin analogs confirmed that, despite the presence of five hydroxy groups in quercetin, those in positions 3, 3', and 4' are mainly involved in the antioxidant activity of the compound, as well as in its photolability.\", \"We report the optical writing in the liquid crystal (LC) cell with a photo-crosslinkable polymer alignment surfaces. Double-faced writing is successfully demonstrated in a guest-host mode LC cell by exposing the cell from both sides with an unpolarized UV light. Different LC alignment patterns are performed on both alignment substrates. Written images can individually be visualized when a polarizer is replaced in front of and behind the cell. Logical operations for two written images are also obtained when the LC cell is set between the polarizer and anarizer.\", \"The laser properties and photostability of R6G was investigated in polymer solid-state matrix consisted from copolymers methylmethacrylate (MMA) with 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) in the 1: 1 ratio and in hybrid polymer consisted from the same monomers MMA+HEMA and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) The 2-nd harmonic of a Nd-YAG laser was used for pumping of active media. It was shown that laser efficiency of R6G in both type of matrix is comparable whereas the laser lifetime of R6G in hybrid material is noticeably longer then in P(MMA+HEMA).\", \"The stability to visible light of five 4-diethylaminoazobenzenes was investigated in different solvents under Various experimental conditions, as well as in solid crystalline form and on dyed poly(ethyleneterephthalate). Though generally exhibiting relatively high photostability, all investigated dyes underwent photodegradation in acetone solution. Two different reaction paths were recognised in this solvent, depending on the nature and position of the substituting groups on the second aromatic ring, both involving the formation and subsequent fragmentation of organic free radicals, as suggested by the strong inhibiting effect of molecular oxygen on the photodegradation rate.

Photochemical properties of RF were characterized by UV-VIS spectral analysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, and photostability testing. Pharmacokinetic study was conducted in rats after intravenous administration of FMT (1 mg/kg) formulation containing RF (0.01 mg/kg). The UV-VIS spectral pattern of RF partly overlapped with the sunlight spectrum, and ROS generation from photoirradiated RF was remarkable; thus, RF had high photoreactive potential. In the photostability testing, after irradiation (250 W/m(2)), degradation rate for FMT in FMT/RF was ca. 11-fold higher than that in FMT alone. The addition of radical scavengers to FMT/RF led to attenuated photodegradation of FMT/RF; in particular, the addition of L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C; VC) to FMT/RF showed ca. 86% inhibition of the photodegradation of FMT/RF. The pharmacokinetic study on FMT indicated that the addition of VC (1 mg/kg) to FMT/RF had no significant impact on the pharmacokinetic behavior of FMT. These findings suggest that ROS-mediated photochemical reaction would be involved in the photodegradation pathway of FMT/RF, and the complementary use of VC might be an attractive approach to improve the photostability of FMT/RF.

The photostability of vitamin A palmitate was also tested in encapsulated systems (Tagravit(R) A, microcapsules, Lipotec(R) liposomes, phosphatidylcholine liposomes, and Lipotec(R) nanocapsules) dispersed in gels at pH 5.6 and 7.0. The stability of retinyl palmitate over time in hydroxy ethyl cellulose hydrogels at pH 5.6 and 7.0 (stored one month) at 25degreesC or 40degreesC, alone or with butylated hydroxy toluene, was also tested. The stability of retinyl palmitate over time in encapsulated systems, dispersed in gels at pH 5.6 and 7.0, was also studied.\\nO/W emulsions were also prepared to compare the stability of vitamin A palmitate introduced in a lipophilic/hydrophilic medium (O/W emulsions) and a hydrophilic medium (hydrogels). HPLC analysis showed that encapsulated systems such as Lipotec(R) nanocapsules, Tagravit(R) A, microcapsules, phosphatidylcholine liposomes, and Lipotec(R) liposomes protect the vitamin A ester over time from hydrolysis and from oxidation to retinaldeide and retinoic acid, and that Lipotec(R) nanocapsules and phosphaticlylcholine liposomes also improve the vitamin's photostability. A change in pH (from 5.6 to 7.0) of the gels did not influence the vitamin ester's stability. pH levels of 4.0 and 8.0 determined a decrease in the stability of retinyl palmitate in the gels. A high concentration of sunscreens improved the photostability of retinyl palmitate in the gels at pH 5.6 and 7.0. Butylated hydroxy toluene protected retinyl palmitate from degradation induced by light at all the pH levels Studied and by heat at pH 5.6 and 7.0, as can be seen from the study of the photostability of vitamin A palmitate under UVB and UVA and of stability over time.\\nRheological studies showed a slight decrease in the viscosity of the gels after UVB-UVA irradiation and a higher decrease in the viscosity of the gels and the emulsions after storage at 25degreesC and 40degreesC. This decrease can be attributed to a partial degradation of hydroxy ethyl cellulose and of emulsifier, as can be seen from the decrease in shear stress versus shear rate values under these conditions of storage, denoting a depolymerization of the rheological modifier.\", \"Cyanine dye beta-cyclodextrin conjugates were synthesized and were demonstrated to possess greatly enhanced photostability in aqueous solution and in live Swiss 3T3 cells.

Under sunlight, the half-life of derivatives was increased to 1.455.58 h, corresponding to a 6-25- fold improvement over a control red pigment (0.22 h). The degradation of pigment derivatives followed a first-order reaction, and the pigment stability increased with an increasing concentration while it decreased with both an increase and decrease in pH from 7. The stabilities of derivatives decreased in descending order in hexane, ethanol, propanol, methanol, ethyl ether, distilled water, chloroform, and acetonitrile. Pigment stability under UV light (365 nm) showed a pattern similar to stability after exposure to sunlight. After 30 days of incubation at 30 degrees C, more than 80% of the initial derivative contents remained while only 29% of the control red remained. The differences in degradation patterns that control red gradually changed to brown whereas the phenylalanine derivative remained a weak red were confirmed by HPLC analysis.\", \"Using flashlamp excitation, photostability data on 1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-, 1,2,3,5 6 dipropyl-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-, and 2,6-dinitro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-pentamethyl-pyrromethane- (P)-BF2 complexes in the solvent 1,4-dioxane and the solvent mixtures 1,4-dioxane/heptane, 1,4-dioxane/cyclohexane, 1,4-dioxane/ethanol and 1,4-dioxane/hexanol, all ratio 1:4, were obtained.

The potential of the nanocomplex (NCx) formed by microwave synthesis of ZnO quantum dots (QDs) in the presence of Avobenzone (Av) for achieving these goals is reported. The NCx exhibits unique synergy between ZnO QD and Av components, which enhances the photostability and molar absorptivity, extends UVA filtering range, and provides a visible emission that matches the typical human in vivo skin emission color. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations of ZnO-Av hybrid structures and comparison of their spectroscopic features with experiments suggest that ZnO QDs catalyze the formation of highly photostable surface enolate species via aldol condensation reaction. The combination of experiments and computations used in this study can advance the science and technology of photoprotection.\", \"Full inorganic perovskites display their potential to function as stable photovoltaic materials better than the hybrid organic inorganic perovskites. However, to date, the cesium lead iodide perovskite, which displays a promising absorbance range, has suffered from low stability, which degrades to a nonactive photovoltaic phase rapidly. In this work, we show that the black phase of cesium lead iodide can be stabilized when the perovskite dimensionality is reduced. X-ray diffraction, absorbance, and scanning electron microscopy were used to follow the degradation process of various dimensionalities under room conditions and 1 sun illumination. When comparing the effect on the stability and photostability of cesium lead iodide with linear or aromatic barrier molecules, the aromatic barrier molecule displays better photostability for over 700 h without degradation under continuous 1 sun illumination than does the linear barrier molecule. Theoretical calculations show that the addition of the barrier molecule makes a different charge distribution over the perovskite structure, which stabilizes the CsPbI3 black phase. This work provides the possibility to use the CsPbI3 perovskite as a stable photovoltaic material in solar cells.\", \"Benzotriazole (BTZ), benzophenone (BP), nano-TiO2 (NTiO2), and nano-ZnO (NZnO) are potential components of UV protection coatings due to being UV light absorbers. Herein, the UV-protective effects of four acrylic coatings containing individual organic and inorganic UV light absorbers and another four coatings containing both types of absorbers were determined by employing accelerated bamboo aging tests. Although organic absorbers decomposed during aging, their degradation rate decreased in the presence of inorganic absorbers. Moreover, individual organic absorbers were better suited for color stabilization than inorganic ones, with the best bamboo surface photostability enhancement achieved by BTZ-containing coatings (BTZ, BTZ-NZnO, and BTZ-NTiO2). Furthermore, strong synergistic effects were detected for BTZ-NZnO and BTZ-NTiO2, whereas an antagonistic effect was observed for BP-NTiO2 and BP-NZnO. Thus, combinations of organic and inorganic UV light absorbers efficiently inhibited the degradation of the former, with the performance of clear coatings determined by the type of the organic absorber.\", \"The natural cream colour and low photostability of Merino wool are impediments that affect the wool's competitiveness over a wide range of apparel and interior textile products. In particular, these two properties need improvement if the wool is to match the performance of cotton and synthetics in the expanding market for trans-seasonal knitwear. The strategy adopted by the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Sheep Industry Innovation is to improve the whiteness of clean wool by genetic selection and to maintain whiteness through processing by developing a minimum-colour-impact route from fleece to fabric. Recent studies on the 'Information Nucleus' flocks established by the Cooperative Research Centre have confirmed the high heritability of clean wool colour and shown for the first time that photostability is moderately heritable using data from a new photostability test method. A pilot-scale commercial processing trial has shown that significant improvements in the whiteness of knitted products (up to 40 CIE Ganz units) can be achieved by selecting white fleece wools and optimising the processing route to avoid stages that may cause yellowing.\", \"Bis(perfluoroalkanoyl) peroxides reacted with quinolinones and phenoxazones to give the perfluoroalkyl derivatives.

The photodegradation rate of lycopene tended to vary depending on the amount of polyglycerol monostearate ester used. We found that the photodegradation rate of lycopene with polyglycerol monostearate ester was considerably slower than those with gum arabic and gum ghatti. Therefore, this study suggests that the absorption state of the emulsifier on the crystal surface may affect the photodegradation rate of lycopene.\", \"Growth of metal oxide layers on quantum dots (QDs) has been regarded as a good way to improve the photostability of QDs. However, direct growth of metal oxides on individual QD remains a great challenge. Here we report a novel approach to rapidly anchor metal oxides on QD surfaces through a sacrificial oxidation of a self-metal source strategy. As typical core/shell QDs, CdSe/CdS or aluminum doped CdSe/CdS (CdSe/CdS:Al) QDs were chosen and treated with peroxide (benzoyl peroxide). Self-metal sources (cadmium or/and aluminum) can be easily sacrificially oxidized, leading to the quick growth of cadmium oxide (CdO) or aluminum/cadmium hybrid oxides (Al2O3/CdO) on the surface of individual QD for improved photostability. Compared with CdO, Al2O3 possesses excellent barrier properties against moisture and oxygen. Therefore, CdSe/CdS QDs with the protection of an Al2O3/CdO hybrid layer show much superior photostability. Under strong illumination with blue light, the QDs coated with the Al2O3/CdO hybrid layer retained 100% of the original photoluminescence intensity after 70h, while that of the untreated CdSe/CdS:Al, the treated CdSe/CdS and the CdSe/CdS QDs dropped to 65%, 45%, and 5%, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this method can be extended to other metal-doped QD systems, even including some inactive metals difficult to be oxidized spontaneously in an ambient atmosphere, which provides a new way to stabilize QDs for diverse optoelectronic applications.\", \"Bovine serum albumin stabilized gold nanoclusters (BSA-Au nanoclusters) have been widely studied due to their possible applications in biomedicine as sensors, fluorescent or multi-modality markers, and therapeutic agents. Synthesis and optical properties of these nanoclusters have been extensively investigated; however, there is still very little data on photostability of BSA-Au nanoclusters. Photostability of BSA-Au nanoclusters is of major importance for a variety of applications, such as material sensing and fluorescence imaging. Herein we demonstrate that after synthesis the BSA-Au solution has two photoluminescence (PL) bands peaking at 468 and 660 nm. Nevertheless, a different behaviour of the PL bands at 468 and 660 nm upon irradiation indicates that only band at 660 nm is related to PL of Au nanoclusters. BSA-Au nanoclusters exhibit great colloidal stability and do not undergo irreversible changes when heated up to 65 degrees C. However, irradiation of BSA-Au nanoclusters causes a wavelength dependent decrease of intensity and a hypsochromic shift of the PL band at 660 nm which is proportional to the delivered dose. The shift of the PL band at 660 nm could occur due to loss of several gold atoms in Au nanoclusters and/or due to deterioration of a nanoparticle coating layer. We have also demonstrated that the photostability of BSA-Au nanoclusters increases in the cell growth medium.\", \"Fluorescent nanoparticles (NPs) represent a new group of contrast agents for bioimaging. One of the challenging problems in this area is to fabricate fluorescent NPs with improved brightness, photostability and biocompatibility. The recently discovered aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens, which exhibit enhanced emission upon aggregate formation, may circumvent these problems. Incorporating AIE fluorophores into the NP platform results in AIE dots with greatly enhanced fluorescence efficiency and superior photostability. In this review, we will summarize our effort in the last five years on the fabrication of AIE dots and their applications in bioimaging.\", \"Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) is a frequently used indicator for mitochondrial function. Herein, we report a photostable near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dye for monitoring MMP. This new probe, named NIMAP, is non-fluorescent in aqueous solution and can be activated by cell membranes, providing high fluorescence contrast and low background fluorescence. NIMAP has been validated for monitoring MMP in living mammalian cells and in mice. Due to the large fluorescence response, low fluorescence background, high photostability, and excellent tissue penetration resulting from red-shifted excitation and emission in the \\\"optical window\\\" above 600 nm, broad applications of this new probe are expected.\", \"The phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes were modified by allylation and consecutive hydrosilylation, and covalently incorporated into the silica nanoparticles by hydrolysis and condensation reaction with TEOS. These nanoparticles showed an excellent photochemical and thermal stability, and a very high luminescent efficiency due to the blocking of O-2 quenching and suppression of energy transfer through the amorphous silica solid solution. The limited mobility of complexes in the silica matrix also resulted in a decrease in the vibration relaxation and restrained the nonradiative decay. It is expected that these photostable and very efficient phosphorescent nanoparticles can be used in various fields ranging from nanobiotechnology to nanoengineering materials, where long-term stability with the high luminescent efficiency is required. As an example of the use of excellent photostability, a preliminary test result in which they are used as a color converter in a light emitting diode (LED) is also discussed.\", \"Sunscreens are used to protect the human skin against harmful UV radiation. Today there is a trend toward higher sun protection factors (SPF) and better UVA protection. Methods for the assessment of SPF and UVA protection involve irradiation of the product, and the photostability properties of the sunscreen have an influence on its performance. Sunscreens often contain more than one UV filter. Thus it is important to understand the photostability properties of the complete system. The filter combinations used may exhibit destabilizing, stabilizing or inert interactions. For that reason, besides assessment of the properties of the single filters, photostabilities of binary filter combinations are investigated. Destabilization occurs when two UV absorbers undergo a chemical reaction after absorption of UV radiation. Stabilization may be achieved when the optical density of the system is very high, giving rise to a self-protection effect of the sunscreen film. Photounstable UV absorbers may be additionally stabilized by employing triplet quenchers. Being aware of these mechanisms and applying them for specific UV filter combinations can help in designing efficient sunscreens.\", \"An aqueous phase synthesis of CdTe and CdTe/CdS core-shell quantum dots with use of L-cysteine as ligand was reported, and the influence of reflux time and temperature on the optical properties of CdTe quantum dots was discussed, and capable method of improving the stability under light irradiation was proposed. The optical properties of quantum dots were studied using UV-visible absorption and fluorescence spectrometers. Results show that the prepared CdTe quantum dots have relatively narrow fluorescent emission bands with peaks in a range of 525-565 nm. The XRD and TEM characterizations indicate that the prepared CdTe quantum dots possess pure phase and good dispersion with average particle size of 2 similar to 3 nm, but their photostability is much poor. Comparatively, the photostability can be improved significantly for the CdTe/CdS core-shell quantum dots. Comprehensive investigations on the CdTe/CdS core-shell quantum dots were carried out with UV-visible absorption, fluorescence, TEM and XRD characterizations.\", \"The cocrystals and salts of an antiallergic drug, tranilast, were synthesized to improve its solubility and photostability. Two tranilast cocrystals with urea (1) and nicotinamide (2), as well as two salts with cytosine (3) and sodium ion (4), were obtained and characterized by infrared spectra, thermogravimetric analyses, differential scanning calorimetry, and powder and single crystal X-ray diffractions. The results of single crystal structure analyses of 1-3 indicate that tranilast combines amide groups in coformers via R-2(2) (8) synthon, resulting in a 1:1 stoichiometry. The complexes showed advantages in terms of solubility and photostability in comparison to pure tranilast. The maximum solubility values of 1-3 in phosphate buffer of pH 6.8 are approximately 1.6, 1.9, and 2.0 times as large as that of tranilast, and the residual of tranilast is 79.5, 92.9, 88.5, 86.2, and 87.4% for tranilast and 1-4, respectively, under the fluorescent lamp irradiation for 96 h.\", \"We report the study of fluorescence quenching from nanoassemblies formed by Rhodamine 6G and gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) of 2.6 nm radius. The presence of Au NPs induces long-term degradation of the photostability (photobleaching) of Rhodamine 6G used as a gain medium in a Fabry-Perot laser cavity. We found that the degradation gets profound when the Au NPs concentration is significantly increased. Calculation of the radiative rate and direct time-resolved measurement of the fluorescence decay indicates that both the decrease of radiative decay rate and increase of non-radiative decay rate are responsible for the fluorescence quenching and photostability degradation. An energy transfer from the dye molecules to gold nanoparticles is dominating within small distance between them and suppresses the quantum efficiency of Rhodamine 6G drastically. In a long time scale, the photobleaching rate was slowing down, and the laser output intensity reached a stabilized level which depends on the gold nanoparticles concentration.

The absorption is measured for different pH of solutions. The changes caused by addition of ethanol and triton, are also investigated. It was observed that the photostability of the dye, in both water solution and sol-gel, depends strongly on pH and temperature. The higher photostability is observed for higher pH. It is shown that for thiocarbocyanine immobilized in sol-gel matrix, the photodegradation is slower than in the case of water and alcohol solutions.\", \"The rate control of decolorization of photochromic chalcone containing polymer with spiropyran dye was achieved successfully by virtue of [2pi + 2pi] photo-cycloaddition between the chalcone units. The kinetic measurement was conducted to prove the photostability of the merocyanine chromophore that is colored species of spiropyran. The chalcone-epoxy polymer system that contains chalcone group in the repeating unit was proved to retard the decaying behavior of photochromism most effectively resulting from the steric hindrance after UV irradiation.

Herein, using ZnO to encapsulate ZnS nanoparticles is proposed as an effective strategy to enhance photocatalytic activity and anti-photocorrosion. The ZnS/ZnO core/shell heterostructures are obtained via an annealing treatment of ZnS nanoparticles produced by a facile wet chemical approach. Due to its small size, the nascent cubic sphalerite ZnS (s-ZnS) converts into a hexagonal wurtzite ZnS (w-ZnS)/ZnO core/shell structure after annealing treatment. In situ oxidation leads to increasing ZnO, simultaneously decreasing the w-ZnS content in the resultant w-ZnS/ZnO with thermal annealing time. The w-ZnS/ZnO core/shell heterostructures show high photocatalytic activity, demonstrated by the photodegradation rate of methylene blue being up to ten-fold and seven-fold higher than that of s-ZnS under UV and visible light irradiation, respectively, and the high capability of degrading rhodamine B. The enhanced photocatalytic activity may be attributed to the large specific surface and improved charge carrier separation at the core/shell interface. Moreover, it displays high photostability owing to the protection of the ZnO shell, greatly inhibiting the photocorrosion of ZnS. This facile in situ oxidation is effective and easily scalable, providing opportunities for developing novel core/shell structure photocatalysts with high activity and photostability.\", \"The present study examined the phototoxicities of a series of 7- (3-aminopyrrolidinyl) quinolones containing various substituents at position I by use of a mouse model. For the 7- (3-aminopyrrolidinyl) quinolones with a halogen atom at position 8, well-known substituent groups such as a cyclopropyl, an ethyl, or a difluorophenyl at position I were found to be responsible for severe phototoxicity. However, when an aminodifluorophenyl or an isoxazolyl group was placed at position 1, even 8-halogeno quinolones were found to be mildly phototoxic. This is the first report of 8-halogenc, quinolones that are not severely phototoxic. Two structurally similar 8-chloro quinolones (the 1-aminodifluorophenyl 8-chloro quinolone and the I-difluorophenyl 8-chloro quinolone) were investigated further. The former was mildly phototoxic; the latter was severely phototoxic. We demonstrate that these two 8-chloro quinolones have practically the same areas under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 4 h in auricular tissue, suggesting that the mild phototoxicity is not due to pharmacokinetic instability. The rates of UV photodegradation of these compounds were also measured. We found that these two quinolones photodegrade at similar rates, suggesting that the mild phototoxicity is not attained through increased photostability. In conclusion, the phototoxic potentials of fluoroquinolones are influenced not only by the substituent at position 8 but also by that at position 1. We also discovered a mildly phototoxic 8-chloro quinolone which did not have increased photostability.\", \"The photostability of drugs has been widely studied while less attention is devoted to the possible modifications that UV light may induce on the excipients of a dosage form, in particular, on the functional polymers used to modulate drug delivery. In this work we have evaluated the effect of UV light on the release characteristics of extended-release matrix tablets containing hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) or polyethylene oxide (PEO) as retarding polymers. Two different model drugs have been used: nifedipine (insoluble and photolabile drug) and diltiazem (soluble and photostable drug). Photodecomposition of nifedipine was evaluated and the formation of the photoproducts was followed during the dissolution process. Regarding the dissolution stability, the matrix tablets containing HPMC exposed to UV light have not shown significant differences in drug release profiles compared to the same non-irradiated formulation, while the matrix tablets containing PEO and exposed to the same conditions of UV light have shown a remarkable increase of drug release rate within the first minutes of the dissolution test (burst effect) which is particularly critical because it can cause the loss of the desired therapeutic control.

However, the standard lithography techniques used for the fabrication of the microreactors are quite expensive, time taking and often requires sophisticated clean room fabrication facilities. Here, we have reported a simple, inexpensive yet highly efficient technique for the fabrication of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) based microreactors. Using such PDMS based T-shaped fully circular cross-sectional microreactor, we have successfully synthesized spherical Ag3PO4 nanoparticles with narrow size distribution. We have also investigated the photocatalytic efficiency of these Ag3PO4 nanoparticles, embedded in the channels of a PMMA based photocatalytic microreactor for the visible light assisted degradation of Rhodamine B dye. We observed > 97% degradation within just 15 min of irradiation. Greater photostability of the nanoparticles in the microreactor was experimentally confirmed by comparing the colour change in case of an aqueous solution of the material with that of the coated microreactor. These silver phosphate nanoparticles also demonstrated very high efficiency towards the inhibition of bacterial pathogens, Escherichia Coli even at a very low concentration.\", \"Despite the fact that Ta3N5 absorbs a major fraction of the visible spectrum, the rapid decrease of photocurrent encountered in water photoelectrolysis over time remains a serious hurdle for the practical application of Ta3N5 photoelectrodes. Here, by employing a Co3O4 nanoparticle water oxidation catalyst (WOC) as well as an alkaline electrolyte, the photostability of Ta3N5 electrode is significantly improved. Co3O4/Ta3N5 photoanode exhibits the best durability against photocorrosion to date, when compared with Co(OH)x/Ta3N5 and IrO2/Ta3N5 photoanodes. Specifically, about 75% of the initial stable photocurrent remains after 2 h irradiation at 1.2 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode). Meanwhile, a photocurrent density of 3.1 mA cm-2 has been achieved on Co3O4/Ta3N5 photoanode at 1.2 V vs. RHE with backside illumination under 1 sun AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight. The reason for the relatively high stability is discussed on the basis of electron microscopic observations and photoelectrochemical measurements, and the surface nitrogen content is monitored by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis.\", \"Metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF) studies of the optical brightener Tinopal-CBS (4,4'-distyrylbiphenyl sulfonic sodium salt) have been undertaken using steady-state and time resolved fluorescence measurements on silver island films (SiFs) deposited on glass slides and silver nano-particles adsorbed onto cellulose based filter paper. Nearly a 4.5 fold enhancement in fluorescence intensity is observed from both SiFs and nano-particle deposited cellulose filter paper. In addition an enhanced photostability and decrease in decay time is also observed on SiFs. These results are consistent with two distinct mechanisms of MEF, firstly coupling and transferring of the excited states energies of fluorophores to surface plasmons in the silver island deposited glass films, and secondly, an electric field enhancement effect, which facilitates enhanced absorption of the fluorophores. Our findings reveal significant benefits of enhanced luminescence and prolonged photostability of Tinopal CBS. As such, Plasmon-tinopal constructs offer new material opportunities as well as multifarious applications in the life sciences. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Solubility of AS increased approximately 200 fold at 50% HPCD. The phase-solubility diagram revealed the formation of a 1:1 inclusion complex of A/S-HPCD and a stability constant (k(s)) of 260.5 M(-1). Addition of HPCD significantly decreased the photochemical decomposition rate of A/S at pH 9.0. The apparent-first-order photochemical decomposition rate constants of free and complexed A/S were calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk plot to be 0.329 and 0.156 h(-1), respectively. The in-vitro permeability study showed that the release of A/S from four lest bases followed a Higuchi release model.

The enhancement of fluorescence intensity is accompanied by a strong decrease in fluorescence lifetime. Simultaneously, the increased photostability of curcumin, a pigment showing strong anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antitumorigenic activity, allows long-time detection and monitoring. We believe that the use of plasmonic platforms will improve detection, delivery and imaging of curcumin.\", \"Silylation of riboflavin allowed its incorporation into spherical SiO2 nanoparticles that were able to generate singlet oxygen and oxidize human serum albumin while conferring riboflavin remarkable photostability.\", \"We describe a new class of near infrared (NIR) fluorescent dendrimeric quaterrylenediimide dyes with high photostability and hydrophilicity, functionality, as well as low cytotoxicity.\", \"CdS/MoS2 heterostructures with a branch-like morphology have been prepared via a one-pot hydrothermal method. The as-prepared CdS/MoS2 heterostructures exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity and photostability for the degradation of organic dyes. It is believed that the 2D MoS2 sheets supporting CdS form a large number of interfaces, which may significantly increase the separation of electron/hole pairs, thus greatly enhancing the photocatalytic activity. On the other hand, the matched energy bands of the CdS/MoS2 heterostructure also allow hole transfer from CdS to MoS2, thus reducing CdS corrosion.\", \"The results of this study report the novel use of electrostatic layer-by-layer nanoassembly of biocompatible nanoparticulate TiO2 multilayers to coat irregular nifedipine (NF) microcrystals to increase the photostability of the drug when exposed to simulated sunlight and to increase the dissolution rate and possibly the bioavailability of the drug after oral administration. The photostability of NF microcrystals (35 mu m) coated with multiple bilayers of positively charged PDDA and negatively charged nanosized TiO2 particles (20-25 nm) was measured when exposed to an illuminance of 12 W/m(2) corresponding to a light dose of 30 k lux or 25 W/m(2) corresponding to light dose of 60 k lux. The dissolution rate of nifedipine from the coated microcrystals was measured in simulated gastric fluid containing 0.05% w/v polysorbate 80. Coating with one TiO2 layer increased the shelf life of nifedipine by 30 hours independent of the intensity of the light exposure. With an increase in the number of TiO2 layers; the photostability of the drug was enhanced even more. A TiO2 monolayer decreased the contact angle by 20 degrees for water and 33 degrees for the dissolution medium as compared with uncoated NF surfaces. This increase in wettability due to a decrease in contact angle increased the dissolution rate of nifedipine microcrystals coated with 1 PDDA/TiO2 bilayer 13-fold after 10 minutes, 5-fold after 1 hour, and 2-fold after 12 hours when compared to uncoated microcrystals. It is assumed that TiO2 increased the photostability because the nanoparticulate multilayers acts as a potential filter protecting the drug from damaging light rays reaching the drug crystals. The dissolution rate was increased because the hydrophilic TiO2 nanoparticles increased the aqueous wettability of the drug crystals thereby preventing aggregation in the dissolution medium. This ensured that the maximum drug surface area was exposed to the dissolution medium.\", \"The objective of this work was to verify if hydrophilic gels containing benzophenone-3 loaded nanocapsules (HG-NCBZ3) could improve the sunscreen in vitro effectiveness against UVA radiation and its photostability compared to a conventional hydrogel containing the free sunscreen (HG-BZ3). In parallel, the immune response of the nanostructured system was evaluated by mouse ear swelling test and the local lymph node assay. The nanocapsules were prepared by interfacial deposition of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) and characterized in terms of particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, drug content and encapsulation efficiency. HG-NCBZ3 UV scans showed higher absorption intensity values than HG-NCplacebo, prepared using unloaded nanocapsules. Films of the gels were irradiated with UVA light and the BZ3 recovery was evaluated by HPLC. BZ3 recovery decreased from 100% to 29% for HG-BZ3 and to 56% for HG-NCBZ3 after 13 h. After wavelength scans within 13 h, the relative areas under the curves (AUC) decreased from 1.00 to 0.62 for HG-BZ3 and remained constant for HG-NCBZ3. Sensitization assay showed that stimulation indexes lower than 3 for all the hydrogel samples. Formulations did not induce increases higher than 10% in ear swelling, indicating that the hydrogels did not cause cutaneous sensitization in mice. The nanoencapsulation improved both the photostability and the effectiveness of BZ3 compared to the non-encapsulated sunscreen and the topical application of free and nanoencapsulated BZ3 did not produced significant allergy response in mice.\", \"The spectral luminescence and lasing characteristics of rhodamine 101T and phenalemine 512 embedded in simple and composite gel matrices of different compositions based on tetraethoxysilane were excited by XeCl laser radiation and the second harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser. It is established that a dye interacts with a solid matrix through formation of donor-acceptor and hydrogen-bonded solvates. The dependence of the lasing efficiency on the excitation intensity was determined, as well as the laser photostability of gel systems with dyes. It is shown that the pump conversion efficiency and the laser photostability of dyes in composite gel systems are higher than in simple gel matrices.\", \"Carbon-coated Cu-TiO2 nanocomposite (Cu-TiO2@C) was constructed using one-step method of thermal reduction. Their photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production from methanol aqueous solution was investigated. Under UV-vis light irradiation, the hydrogen yield of the 10 mg optimal Cu-TiO2@C reached 269.1 mu mol h(-1), which was very close to that of Pt@TiO2 (290.8 mu mol h(-1)). The Cu-TiO2@C also displayed much higher photocatalytic stability in comparison with Cu-TiO2 without coated carbon layer. The nano-Cu as photocatalytic active site improve the efficiency of photoinduced carrier separation. The carbon layer with the ability to transfer photogenerated electrons faster and to adsorb hydroxyl radicals more easily, leading to a very significant increase the reaction rate. In addition, the carbon layer can also provide a chemical protection to the Cu nanoparticles and increase the stability of the photocatalysts. The Cu-TiO2@C photocatalyst with the low cost, enhanced photostability and photocatalytic activity is expected to be an excellent nanocomposite t in reforming of biomass or bio-derivatives field.\", \"Lipid droplets (LDs), as dynamic complex organelles,, are involved in various physiological processes, and their numbers and activity are related to many diseases, even cancer. Hence, locating and concentration monitoring of LDs are very important to scientific bioresearch and health care. In this work, we prepared two simple luminogens (FAS and DPAS) via very facile synthetic procedures and purification. They feature aggregation induced emission and excited state intramolecular proton transfer characteristics. They exhibit large Stokes shifts and bright orange and yellow emissions in the aggregated state, and the emissions can be reversibly turned \\\"off\\\" and \\\"on\\\" for many cycles by controlling buffer pH values. Both FAS and DPAS are cytocompatible and can selectively accumulate in and light up the LDs in living cells with superior resolution and high contrast. They also outperform the commercial LD probes in terms of photostability. Combining the advantages of high LD-specificity, good biocompatibility, surperb photostability, and low preparation cost, FAS and DPAS may become powerful tools to the study on LDs-related intracellular activities, such as LDs-based pathology and pharmacology.\", \"Novel phase-boundary photocatalysts were prepared by partial modification of the surface of nanovoid SiO2-TiO2 nanoparticles with octadecyltriethoxysilane (ODTS) and characterized by IR and XRD. The photostability and the photocatalytic activity of the nanoparticles were investigated under UV light irradiation. The results showed that the alkylsilylation groups were successfully grafted on the surfaces of the two nanoparticles, and the phase transfer of the TiO2 core was not observed after ODTS modification. Compared with TiO2 nanoparticles, the surface-alkylsilylated nanovoid SiO2-TiO2 nanoparticles showed excellent photostability and high photocatalytic activity for photodegradation of weak acid yellow G solution with mechanical stirring.\", \"ZnS:Ag nanocrystals with Ag doping concentrations of 1 at% was synthesized by using 3-mercaptopropionicacid (MPA) as stabilizer. A ZnS shell was formed on surface of the ZnS:Ag nanocrystals by the decomposition of Zn-MPA complex under microwave irradiation. The new ZnS shell passivated the nanocrystal surface and resulted in a significant enhancement of the photoluminescent quantum yield and photostability of the nanocrystals. Under optimum reaction conditions, quantum yield of the ZnS:Ag nanocrystals increased from 2.5 to 10.2% after the shell growth. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the vertical growth of ZnO nanorods while the incorporation of rGO to ZnO was investigated by scanning electron microscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The successful photocatalytic reduction of GO was demonstrated by means of Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The photocatalytic behavior and photostability of the sandwich-like rGO-ZnO composite were studied through decolorization of the aqueous solution of acid orange 7 under UV-C illumination. The rGO-ZnO photocatalyst presented higher dye decomposition efficiency than pure ZnO. The hybridization of rGO and ZnO led to a 40 % increase in the pseudo-first-order kinetic model's rate constant and an enhancement of the photostability. The role of incorporation of rGO in enhancement of the ZnO's photostability has been elucidated in the light of specific features of the sandwich-like architecture.\", \"Effect of polydopamine coating on improving photostability of poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s (POD) fiber was studied in detail. Due to strong adhesion ability of polydopamine, the POD fiber could be coated easily by dopamine in Tris-HCl (pH = 8.5) solution at room temperature with exist of oxygen. The polydopamine coating was characterized by SEM, XPS and ATR-FTIR. It was proved by UV-spectra analysis that the polydopamine coating had a strong absorbance in ultraviolet wavelength and was very stable to ultraviolet. Additionally, it was found by pyrogallol autoxidation method that the polydopamine could efficiently capture superoxide anion radical, which was an important factor that resulted in photodegradation of POD fiber, due to its catechol structure. These two findings implied that polydopamine coating was a potential photoprotection agent. Finally, compared to POD fiber, the tensile test of POD fiber coated by polydopamine further proved that the polydopamine did improve the photostability of POD fiber. And the FTIR analysis of POD coated by polydopamine also confirmed that there was almost no macromolecular change after UV exposure.\", \"Aiming at the development of an active food packaging, the goal of this study was to increase stilbenes (resveratrol (RV), pterostilbene (PT) and pinosylvin (PS)) aqueous solubility and stability using hydropropyl-cyclodextrins (HP-CDs) and bile salts. To evaluate stilbene concentration, an HPLC-DAD method was validated. Stilbene solubility was improved by the formation of inclusion complexes and micellar systems with higher solubility values obtained for the inclusion complexes with cyclodextrins. Inclusion complexes revealed a 1:1 stoichiometry for RV and PT and a 1:2 for PS. Solid state characterisation was carried out using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. H-1 NMR studies were also performed to characterise the prepared complexes. Photostability studies revealed that CDs were able to increase stilbene photostability at 4 degrees C. This work showed that stable stilbene solutions can be achieved using hydroxypropyl-CDs, contributing for their incorporation in several materials for the food and pharmaceutical industries.

The prepared composite was characterized by various techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis (TGA-DTA), and UV-vis spectroscopy. The obtained results show that MY3 anions were intercalated into the interlayer spacing of LDH as observed from PXRD and FT-IR. Furthermore, the intercalation of MY3 anions into the LDH markedly enhances the thermo- and photostability of MY3, which may enlarge the practical application fields of MY3 dye.\", \"Photostability of organic photovoltaic devices represents a key requirement for the commercialization of this technology. In this field, ZnO is one of the most attractive materials employed as an electron transport layer, and the investigation of its photostability is of particular interest. Indeed, oxygen is known to chemisorb on ZnO and can be released upon UV illumination. Therefore, a deep analysis of the UV/oxygen effects on working devices is relevant for the industrial production where the coating processes take place in air and oxygen/ZnO contact cannot be avoided. Here we investigate the light-soaking stability of inverted organic solar cells in which four different solution-processed ZnO-based nanoparticles were used as electron transport layers: (i) pristine ZnO, (ii) 0.03 at %, (iii) 0.37 at %, and (iv) 0.8 at % aluminum-doped AZO nanoparticles. The degradation of solar cells under prolonged illumination (40 h under 1 sun), in which the ZnO/AZO layers were processed in air or inert atmosphere, is studied. We demonstrate that the presence of oxygen during the ZnO/AZO processing is crucial for the photostability of the resulting solar cell. While devices based on undoped ZnO were particularly affected by degradation, we found that using AZO nanoparticles the losses in performance, due to the presence of oxygen, were partially or totally prevented depending on the Al doping level.\", \"Retinoids play a very important role in the topical treatment of acne vulgaris. However, their use is restricted because of the limited photostability responsible for local adverse effects as erythema, dryness, itching, and stinging. In this way, the therapeutic efficacy of such molecules is strongly reduced, resulting, at the same time, harmful for the patient upon light exposure. Thus, a suitable technological strategy is necessary to increase retinoid stability in order to have a product both safe and efficacious. With this aim, new inorganic-organic hybrids based on tretinoin (retinoic acid, RET) and hydrotalcite-like compounds (HTlc) have been prepared and well characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, inductively coupled plasma spectrometry, thermal analyses, scanning electron microscopy, and UV-Vis spectrophotometric measurements. Such hybrids, namely, ZnAl-HTlc-RET and MgAl-HTlc-RET, were formulated as simple gels for topical use and submitted to further studies in order to evaluate their rheological properties, photostability, and RET release capability. The RET photostability resulted improved upon intercalation into HTlc, both in MgAl-HTlc and ZnAl-HTlc, as proved by the data acquired during irradiation of the sample at 366 nm. This strategy is suitable for the realization of safe, efficacious, and compliant topical formulations for acne treatment.

Photostability and moisture uptake properties of wood veneers coated with a combination of hybrid inorganic-organic thin sol-gel films and organic light stabilizers was investigated. The light stabilizers were applied by brushing, and the thin sol-gel films were deposited on the wood surface by dipping in a sol prepared from a mixture of methyltrimethoxysilane, hexadecyltrimethoxysilane, and aluminum isopropoxide precursors. Although the sol-gel film improved the moisture resistance of the wood veneers, it showed mixed results on photostability. Under light and spray conditions in a Weather-Ometer (TM), specimens treated with a combination of sol-gel thin film and a UV absorber, tris-resorcinol triazine and an acrylic self-crosslinking binder, or treated with lignin stabilizer/tris-resorcinol triazine/acrylic self-crosslinking binder showed good overall weathering performance. Under permanent light conditions in the Weather-Ometer (TM), specimens treated with a combination of sol-gel thin film, a lignin stabilizer, and a water soluble UV absorber - namely: (2-hydroxyphenyl)-benzotriazole - revealed a good overall weathering performance. This study has demonstrated the feasibility of using a combination of organic light stabilizers and sol-gel deposits of hybrid inorganic-organic thin films to improve weathering resistance of softwood substrates.\", \"Thermal and photostability of a commercial dried extract and capsules of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) were evaluated under the ICH test conditions. The extract was considered as drug substance and its preparations as drug products. In addition, capsules of different colours corresponding to different opaficient and pigment contents were also evaluated as primary package of drug product and the tests in the secondary pack were performed with amber containers, as well. A selective high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for determination of stability of all the characteristic constituents, namely flavonols, hyperforins and hypericins, was carried out. Photostability testing showed all the constituents to be photosensitive in the tested conditions. However, different opaficients and pigments present in the capsules influenced the stability of the different classes of constituents. Amber containers suggested as secondary packages influenced only in part the photostability of the investigated constituents. Long-term thermal stability testing showed a very low (less than 4 months) hyperforins and hypericins t(90), even if ascorbic and citric acids were added to the formulation. From the results we have obtained it is clear that for St. John's wort preparations, a mere translation of the ICH guidelines to the field of herbal products, as suggested by the WPHMP of the EMEA, cannot be accepted. A revision and adaptation of the storage conditions should be elaborated.

The modified titanium dioxide can efficiently absorb visible irradiation. The samples were characterized by means of wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The as-prepared photocatalyst exhibited good photostability and photocatalytic performance in the degradation of organic compounds. For model organic pollutants, modified titanium dioxide had excellent visible-light photocatalytic performance and the surface chemistry linkage product had high photostability.\", \"The resveratrol functionalized carboxymethyl-beta-cyclodextrin conjugate was synthesized by two simple steps. The conjugate was successfully demonstrated by H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, UV, and FTIR. The photostability of the conjugate was studied by ultraviolet absorption spectrum. After 360 min of UV light irradiation, the conjugate showed a total loss in absorbance of only 12.54%, while the resveratrol and its CM-beta-CD inclusion complex showed a total loss in absorbance of 32.15% and 24.05%, respectively. The results indicate that the conjugate was more stable than resveratrol and its CM-beta-CD inclusion complex.\", \"The role of C2-substituents in the imidazolone ring of borated GFP chromophore derivatives (4-(2-(difluoroboryl)benzylidene)-1H-imidazol-5(4H)-ones) in the degradation process was studied. It was found that the nature of this substituent hardly affected their photostability, whereas their sensitivity toward nucleophilic reagents decreased with an increase in size and donating properties of the substituent. The results supported an assumption that the introduction of C2 substituents was not a rate-limiting step of the degradation process of these derivatives and complex C2 substituents were not effective tools for the improvement of their stability.\", \"Photovoltachromic cells (PVCCs) are of great interest for the self-powered smart windows of architectures and vehicles, which require widely tunable transmittance and automatic color change under photo stimuli. Organolead halide perovskite possesses high light absorption coefficient and enables thin and semitransparent photovoltaic device. In this work, we demonstrate co-anode and co-cathode photovoltachromic supercapacitors (PVCSs) by vertically integrating a perovskite solar cell (PSC) with MoO3/Au/MoO3 transparent electrode and electrochromic supercapacitor. The PVCSs provide a seamless integration of energy harvesting/storage device, automatic and wide color tunability, and enhanced photostability of PSCs. Compared with conventional PVCC, the counter electrodes of our PVCSs provide sufficient balancing charge, eliminate the necessity of reverse bias voltage for bleaching the device, and realize reasonable in situ energy storage. The color states of PVCSs not only indicate the amount of energy stored and energy consumed in real time, but also enhance the photostability of photovoltaic component by preventing its long-time photoexposure under fully charged state of PVCSs.

The second objective is to highlight the need for global harmonization of photostability testing and UVA protection labelling. Fifteen products with various combinations of UV filters marketed in Europe were assessed based on transmission measurements of 0.75 mg cm(-2) layer covered onto polymethylmethacrylate plate roughness 2 mu m. Two absolute UV spectroscopic indices (in vitro SPF, UVA-PF), four well-known relative UVA indices: the UVA-PF/SPF ratio and critical wavelength by European Commission (EC); UVA/UVB ratio by Boots Star Rating system; UVA1/UV ratio by FDA Proposed Ruling and one new relative indices the Spectral Uniformity Index (SUI) by Diffey, were compared before and after sunlight exposure with dose about 42 SEDs. The UVA-PF values before exposure proved a high degree of variation among samples. After exposure only five sunscreens observed UVA protection standard by EC and the same products showed compliance with the first UVA rating by Boots system (three stars). According to the UVA1/UV ratio, except for one product, all sunscreens manifested certain UVA protection level (low, medium or high). In compliance with criteria of new rating proposed by Diffey, exactly all fifteen sunscreens gave some UVA rating exhibited as SUI (low, medium or high). These results mean that the different UVA protection indices can exhibit various data and be confusing for consumer. Photostability of each product was assessed with three indices: the Area under curve (Auc) Index for the total UV range, and UVB, UVA, UVA2, UVA1 range separately; the residual effectiveness of in vitro SPF and UVA-PF. All fifteen sunscreens were photostable in the UVB region. Seven products exhibited photoinstability in the total UV range (290-400 nm); all of them contained a combination of the ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC) and butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMBM) together with other UV filters. Eight products lacked their stability in the UVA1 range (340-400 nm) thus confirmed that photodegradation of some current sunscreens is primarily problem of this region. The most photoinstability showed sunscreens S1 (EHMC, BMBM and phenylbenzimidazole sulphonic acid) and S6 (EHMC, BMBM, phenylbenzimidazole sulphonic acid and ethylhexyl triazone); Auc-UVA1 Index was 0.15 only. Excellent UVA1 photostability showed sunscreen S8 (EHMC, EHT and methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol); Auc-UVA1 Index was of 1.00. Three sunscreens showed very good UVA1 photostability (Auc-UVA1 Index ranged from 0.98 to 0.93). The fact that these products applied only in the layer of 0.75 mg cm(-2) were photostable under the sunlight dose, which corresponds to layer of 2 mg cm(-2), is proof of their quality. Comparison of the residual effectiveness of in vitro SPF and UVA-PF values with the Auc-Index showed that methods give a similar ranking of the sunscreens' photostability. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Extending the absorption band to a near-infrared (NIR) region (700nm approximate to) with reasonable photostability is one of the major demands in the rational design of such sensitizers. We herein prepared a series of mono- and bis-palladium complexes(1-Pd-H-2, 2-Pd-H-2, 1-Pd-Pd, and 2-Pd-Pd) based on modified calix[6]phyrins as photosensitizers for singlet oxygen generation. These palladium complexes showed intense absorption profiles in the visible-to-NIR region (500-750nm) depending on the number of central metals. Upon photoirradiation in the presence of 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) as a substrate for reactive oxygen species, the bis-palladium complexes generated singlet oxygen with high efficiency and excellent photostability. Singlet oxygen generation was confirmed from the characteristic spectral feature of the spin trapped complex in the EPR spectrum and the intact O-1(2) emission at 1270nm.\", \"Metal halide perovskites are attractive candidates for the wide band gap absorber in tandem solar cells. While their band gap can be tuned by partial halide substitution, mixed halide perovskites often have lower open-circuit voltage than would be expected and experience photoinduced trap formation caused by halide segregation. We investigate solar cell performance and photostability across a compositional space of formamidinium (FA) and cesium (Cs) at the A-site at various halide compositions and show that using more Cs at the A-site rather than more Br at the X-site to raise band gap is more ideal as it improves both Voc and photostability. We develop band gap maps and design criteria for the selection of perovskite compositions within the Cs(x)FA(1-x)Pb(Bryl) space. With this, we identify perovskites with tandem relevant band gaps of 1.68 and 1.75 eV that demonstrate high device efficiencies of 17.4 and 16.3%, respectively, and significantly improved photostability compared to that of the higher Br-containing compositions.\", \"Fucoxanthin is one of the most abundant carotenoids and possesses a number of beneficial medicinal qualities which include its anti-oxidant, anti-obesity and anti-cancer properties. In this study, the photostability of fucoxanthin in extracts with different chemical profiles was studied. The extracts were obtained from Undaria pinnatifida, a seaweed rich in this carotenoid, using conventional liquid solvent extraction procedures and the QuEChERS method. All the extracts contained all-trans-fucoxanthin as the major compound. Conventional procedures produced a fucoxanthin purity of lower than 50%, whereas after liquid-liquid partition, PSA cleanup, and PSA and GCB cleanup (QuEChERS method) fucoxanthin purity increased to 70%, 86%, and 94%, respectively. Although in the acetone extract the initial content of fucoxanthin was the highest, results demonstrate that coextractives play an important role in enhancing the rate of photodegradation. After light exposure, the conventional extracts lost around 90% of the initial fucoxanthin content. On the other hand, the extracts obtained by the QuEChERS method showed significantly higher light stability than the conventional extracts. These results suggest that the QuEChERS method could be used and further improved to obtain more purified and stable extracts for fucoxanthin from U. pinnatifida.\", \"Solid-state active elements based on poly(urethane-co-siloxanes) with the organic dye rhodamine 6G in their pores are studied. The transparency range of polymer samples is determined. The electronic spectra and the spectra of luminescence and lasing of rhodamine 6G in poly(urethane-co-siloxane) samples are measured. When a polymer obtained at a high content of 2,4-toluene diisocyanate is doped with rhodamine 6G, the luminescence spectrum narrows by a factor of 10. It is shown that the polymers doped with rhodamine 6G feature high photostability. The photostability of rhodamine 6G molecules is strongly dependent on the content of the dimethylsiloxane component in the polymer.

A strong dependence of the photostability on the distance from the metal surface is found. The experimental data are well described in a classical electromagnetic model with the additional assumption that photobleaching occurs at a constant rate from the excited state. The metal interface influences the photostability of the chromophores in two ways, first by altering the excitation rate by local enhancement of the electromagnetic field and second by altering the electromagnetic decay rate.

To explore whether QDs could specifically and effectively label tumor markers and be used in immunohistochemistry as a novel type of fluorescent probe, we used quantum dots with maximum emission wavelength 605 nm (QD605) to detect the ovarian carcinoma marker CA125 in specimens of different types (fixed cells, tissue sections, and xenograft piece). Additionally, we compared the photostability of QD signals with that of a conventional organic dye, FITC. All labeling signals of QDs were found to be more specific and brighter than those of FITC. Moreover, the QDs exhibited exceptional photostability during continuous illumination for 1 h by a high-intensity laser (Ar laser power 100 mW) at 488 nm, while the FITC signals faded very quickly and became undetectable after 24 min of illumination. These results indicate that QD-based probes can offer substantial advantages over existing fluorophores in many applications, and can be used effectively in immunohistochemistry as a novel class of fluorescent probes.\", \"Biodegradable polymer biomaterials with intrinsical photoluminescent properties have attracted much interest, due to their potential advantages for tissue regeneration and noninvasive bioimaging. However, few of current biodegradable polymers possess tunable intrinsically fluorescent properties, such as high photostability, fluorescent lifetime, and quantum field, and strong mechanical properties for meeting the requirements of biomedical applications. Here, by a facile one-step thermal polymerization, elastomeric poly(silicone-citrate) (PSC) hybrid polymers are developed with controlled biodegradability and mechanical properties, tunable inherent fluorescent emission (up to 600 nm), high photostability (beyond 180 min for UV and six months for natural light), fluorescent lifetime (near 10 ns) and quantum yield (16%-35%), high cellular biocompatibility, and minimal inflammatory response in vivo, which provide advantages over conventional fluorescent dyes, quantum dots, and current fluorescent polymers. The promising applications of PSC hybrids for cell and implants imaging in vitro and in vivo are successfully demonstrated. The development of elastomeric PSC polymer may provide a new strategy in synthesizing new inorganic-organic hybrid photoluminescent materials for tissue regeneration and bioimaging applications.\", \"Lysosomes function as important organelles within cells and their movement associates with diverse biological events, hence the real-time tracking of lysosomal movement is of great significance. However, since most lysosome fluorescent probes suffer from relatively unsatisfactory photostability, tracking lysosomal movement in real-time remains challenging. Here, we report that a naphthalimide-based fluorescent compound, namely NIMS, is a quite promising probe for lysosome imaging. The visualizing mechanism lies in the selective accumulation of NIMS in lysosomes via a protonation reaction, followed by the fluorescence enhancement due to the interactions of NIMS with proteins. Owing to its high selectivity and good photostability, NIMS was successfully applied to capture super-resolution fluorescence images of lysosomes. More importantly, real-time tracking of lysosome movement in a single living cell by NIMS was realized with a confocal laser scanning microscope. Surprisingly, even in normal culture conditions, around 2/3 of the captured lysosomes were observed to move within 5 min, indicative of the highly dynamic features of lysosomes. Thus, this probe may facilitate the understanding of the lysosome dynamics in physiological or pathological conditions.\", \"Zinc oxide nanorods (ZnO NRs) have emerged in recent years as extremely useful, optical signal-enhancing platforms in DNA and protein detection. Although the use of ZnO NRs in biodetection has been demonstrated so far in systems involving many ZnO NRs per detection element, their future applications will likely take place in a miniaturized setting while exploiting single ZnO NRs in a low-volume, highthroughput bioanalysis. In this paper, we investigate temporal and spatial characteristics of the biomolecular fluorescence on individual ZnO NR systems. Quantitative and qualitative examinations of the biomolecular intensity and photostability are carried out as a function of two important criteria, the time and position along the long axis (length) of NRs. Photostability profiles are also measured with respect to the position on NRs and compared to those characteristics of biomolecules on polymeric control platforms. Unlike the uniformly distributed signal observed on the control platforms, both the fluorescence intensity and photostability are position-dependent on individual ZnO NRs. We have identified a unique phenomenon of highly localized, fluorescence intensification on the nanorod ends (FINE) of well-characterized, individual ZnO nanostructures. When compared to the polymeric controls, the biomolecular fluorescence intensity and photostability are determined to be higher on individual ZnO NRs regardless of the position on NRs. We have also carried out finite-difference time-domain simulations the results of which are in good agreement with the observed FINE. The outcomes of our investigation will offer a much needed basis for signal interpretation for biodetection devices and platforms consisting of single ZnO NRs and, at the same time, contribute significantly to provide insight in understanding the biomolecular fluorescence observed from ZnO NR ensemble-based systems.\", \"A variety of fluorescent nanoparticles have been developed for demanding applications such as optical biosensing and fluorescence imaging in live cells. Silica-based fluorescent nanoparticles offer diverse advantages for biological applications. For example, they can be used as labeling probes due to their low toxicity, high sensitivity, resolution, and stability. In this research, a new class of highly fluorescent, efficient nanoparticles composed of a newly synthesized poly[di(2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy))-2,7-(9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene)](PDDF) core and a silica shell (designated as PDDF@SiO2) were prepared using a simple reverse micelle method, and their fluorescent properties were evaluated using methods such as single-dot photoluminescence measurements. The enhanced photostability of the particles and their potential applications for bioanalysis are discussed in this article. The morphology, size, and fluorescent properties for prepared PDDF@SiO2 nanoparticles were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The prepared particles size, which was approximately 60 nm, resulted in an excellent colloidal stability in a physiological environment. The photobleaching dynamics, total numbers of emitted photons (TNEP) and statistical measurements of individual nanoparticles were observed using laser scanning fluorescence microscopy to assess the structure and photostability of PDDF@SiO2 nanoparticles. Additionally, PDDF@SiO2 nanoparticles were used in cell toxicity and permeation tests for biological analyses, demonstrating a great potential for use as powerful, novel materials within the emerging fields of biosensing and biomedical engineering.

However, during the development of new pharmaceutical products, the evaluation of percutaneous absorption and in vivo effectiveness should be accompanied by evaluation of stability parameters as an integral part of the process. Objective: The aim was to investigate the stability of the final microemulsion formulation considering the temperature ranges of storage and application. Methods: The physical, chemical, and functional stability of this formulation under different conditions of storage during 12 months and the photostability of quercetin incorporated into this system over UVB exposure for 7 days were evaluated. Results: Although the results indicated a notable physical stability of the w/o microemulsions during the experimental period under all employed conditions, in both, the chemical and functional studies, a significant loss of quercetin content and antioxidant activity was found after 6 months of storage at 30 degrees C/70% relative humidity and after 2 months at 40 degrees C/70% relative humidity. The photostability study results demonstrated that the incorporation of quercetin into the w/o microemulsion maintained the previously demonstrated photostability of this flavonoid under forced exposure to UVB irradiation. Conclusion: Thus, this work demonstrates that special storage conditions (at 4 +/- 2 degrees C) are necessary to maintain the functionality of the w/o microemulsion containing quercetin and mainly emphasizes the importance of studying physical, chemical, and functional parameters at the same time during stability evaluation of active principles.\", \"A fluorescent photochromic diarylethene, which has excellent photostability and efficient fluorescence switching character even at the single-molecule level, was synthesized and the fatigue resistant property was quantitatively evaluated.\", \"Investigations on the photochemical stability of pharmaceutical substances are mandatory in drug development and licensing as photo-induced degradation of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) may not only lead to decreased API concentrations but also to toxic or reactive products. Thus, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) issued Guidance for Industry Q1B \\\"Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products\\\" for testing of pure but also packed drugs. However, photoproducts are also known to be generated in vivo under sunlight exposure of the skin and lead to considerable amounts of adverse drug effects.\\nHerein we present an alternative system that may be used for photostability testing mimicking both situations. It combines a tailored photoreactor with an exchangeable pen light source and a modified HPLC system with online-SPE. Identification of photoproducts may be performed using mass spectrometry. The potential of accurate mass spectrometry as a tool for identification of photoproducts was demonstrated as well. A comparison of the online photoreactor system and the traditional photochamber irradiation was performed using ketoprofen for proof of concept. In both designs acetylbenzophenone and ethylbenzophenone were detected as main photoproducts. The new device allows for fast and easy photostability studies that may help to reduce time consuming in vitro experiments and animal trials. Using state of the art instruments kinetic studies could also easily be performed with qualitative and quantitative perspectives combined into one experimental design with only very low amounts of API needed. This may be useful in early drug development, where only small amounts of API are available. Scale-up may also be easily realized for the generation of reference material for quantification and quality control (QC) processes as well as for toxicity testing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The possibility of using xanthenes ( rhodamine 101, fluorescein and 5( 6)- carboxyfluorescein) and selected azo dyes ( alizarin yellow R, alizarin yellow 2G and carboxyaesenazo) as sensitizers has been explored. Fluorescence and electronic absorption measurements revealed complex formation between the chosen dyes and the surface of the colloidal TiO2. The apparent association constants ( K-app) of the surface complexes have been estimated and are correlated with the dye-induced negative shifts of the reduction potential of colloidal TiO2 nanoparticles. Moreover, due to its utmost importance, photostability of the organic dyes in absence and presence of colloidal TiO2 nanoparticles and the influence of the used electrolyte have been examined. The results point to a remarkable enhancement of photostability in the presence of the electrolyte ( I-3(-)/ I-), which is attributed to fast regeneration of the neutral dye via the redox couple of the electrolyte. Furthermore, photocurrent action spectrum of the fabricated and tested DSC shows the origin of photoelectric output to be optical absorption of the dye used.\", \"Gold nanoparticles embedded in an optical gain material, particularly in a water solution of Rhodamine 6G, used in dye lasers can both increase and damp dye flourescence, thus changing the laser output intensity.

These switches ensured an efficiency of 40% in passive Q switching of neodymium lasers (lambda = 1.318 and 1.34 mu m). The maximum energy of 0.16 J and the minimum duration of 18 ns were achieved for single pulses. Passive mode locking was employed to generate ultrashort pulses of 35-60 ps duration with an energy of 6-10 mJ in a train.

In this paper, we subsequently study and reveal that tin nanodeposits are a suitable metal for MEF with an electric field wavelength dependence somewhat different than silver. An enhanced fluorescence emission coupled with a reduced fluorophore lifetime suggests both an electric field and plasmon-coupling component are the underlying mechanisms for tin-based MEF. In addition, an enhanced fluorophore photostability is observed near-to tin nanodeposits.\", \"For luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs), it is important to enhance the fluorescence quantum yield (FQY) and photostability. Our measurements have demonstrated that the addition of silver nanoparticles to dye solution causes broadening of absorption bands, so the spectral range of sunlight absorbed by LSC has increased. Silver nanoparticles (NPs) were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-Vis absorption spectra. UV-Vis spectrum showed a single peak at 442 nm due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The position of SPR peak exhibited a red shift after the sample was exposed to UV irradiation (unfiltered light). The optical band gap values have a reduction from 2.46 to 2.37 eV after irradiation for 960 minutes. Such reduction in optical band gap may be due to change in particle size calculated using Mie theory. The photostability of organic dyes used was improved after adding silver nanoparticles. The area under fluorescence spectra of dyes with silver NPs increased by 41-31% when compared with identical dye concentrations without silver nanoparticles as a result of interaction of the species with silver NPs.\", \"The purpose of this study was to design cyclodextrin (CyD)-based pseudorotaxane-like supramolecular complexes with various isoprenoid compounds, such as reduced coenzyme Q10 (R-CowQ10), squalene, tocotrienol, and teprenone, and to evaluate their pharmaceutical properties. Squalene, tocotrienol, and teprenone formed precipitates with beta-CyD and gamma-CyD in aqueous solution, whereas R-CoQ10 formed precipitates with gamma-CyD aqueous solution. The results of powder X-ray diffraction and H-1-NMR analyses indicated that these precipitates are derived from pseudorotaxane-like supramolecular complexes. The photostability of teprenone was markedly improved by complexation with CyDs, especially in the gamma-CyD system. In addition, the dispersion rates of teprenone in the gamma-CyD system were higher than those in the beta-CyD system, compared with the corresponding physical mixtures. In conclusion, pharmaceutical properties such as photostability and dispersion rates of isoprenoid compounds were improved by the formation of pseudorotaxane-like supra molecular complexes with beta-CyD and/or gamma-CyD.\", \"Sunscreen agents are commonly used in cosmetic products to filter out noxious radiation in sunlight.

However, the study on the photostability and degradation mechanism of nonfullerene OSCs is far behind than that of fullerene-based solar cells, which is crucial for the commercial applications of the technology. Herein, an efficient and stable nonfullerene OSC based on PCE10:rhodanine-benzothiadiazole-coupled indacenodithiophene with branched 2-ethylhexyl side chains (EH-IDT) is fabricated from environmentally benign solvent. The PCE10:EH-IDT solar cell shows a high PCE of 9.17% and a long operational lifetime (T-80) of 2132 h, compared with other two OSCs based on 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2',3'-d']-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b']-dithiophene (ITIC) and another fuse ring acceptor with withdrawing units of 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone and hexyl side chains (IDIC) nonfullerene acceptors, with tested lifetimes of only 221 and 558 h, respectively. As indicated by the Flory-Huggins interaction parameters, ITIC and IDIC have poor miscibility with PCE10, which leads to morphology degradation, suppressed charge generation, increased trap states, and charge recombination in the photoaging test, which accounts for the significant loss of short-circuit current density and fill factor during operation. The improved miscibility of the donor and the acceptor results in a more stable morphology, and the PCE10:EH-IDT solar cells thus achieve an outstanding overall performance that combines high efficiency and superior photostability and paves the way for the potential practical applications of OSCs.\", \"In this work, highly photostable and fluorescent coassembled microsheets were fabricated from molecules 1 and 2 for sensitive and selective detection of BTX.

Furthermore, the combined properties of 1 and 2 components in coassembled microsheets allow distinct responses to BTX and other VOC vapors and thereby yield highly sensitive and selective detection of BTX hydrocarbons via FRET. These findings provide a new approach for the development of photostable fluorescence sensors for hazardous chemicals.\", \"ZnO quantum dots, QDs (5 nm diameter) by their photogenerated charge carriers clearly influence the degradation of the acrylate host matrix, under conditions simulating solar light. As a result, QDs undergo a partial quenching of their fluorescence. To rationalize this influence, the investigation requires understanding the photochemical behavior of the acrylate photopolymer (carrier of ester and ether groups) in the absence of nanofiller. The matrix undergoes simultaneously a post-polymerization and photo oxidative degradation. Infrared analysis and headspace gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry reveal that the main volatile organic compounds result from the oxidation of the ether groups, supposed to be the primary sites of degradation.\\nThe nanofiller increases the rate of degradation. Also, the concentration of the volatile organic compounds is all the more important as the doping percentage increases. However, the photostability of ZnO/polymer material strongly depends on the size of the nanoparticles. Whereas ZnO QDs display a photocatalytic effect, nanoparticles with a bigger size (10-30 nm) exhibit an unexpected UV-screening effect. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Their spectral properties in different solvents showed little effect of solvatochromism (< 10 nm). The methyl groups on the BODIPY skeleton benefit the fluorescence quantum yields (Phi(f) up to 0.80 in water) but affect the photostability of the dyes. Photooxidation and photodegradation experiments suggest that dyes 1a and 2a exhibit excellent photostability, especially in water, and several factors were taken into account to elucidate the experimental phenomena. Dyes 1c and 2c, derived from la and 2a via the esterification of NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester), can be easily acquired in high yields (> 90%). Single crystal X-ray structures of dyes 2c and 3a are also obtained and discussed.

Fluorescent proteins (FPs) have widespread uses in cell biology. However, the practical applications of FPs are significantly limited due to their rapid photobleaching and misfolding when fused to target proteins.\\nNew Method: Using a combination of novel and known mutations to eGFP, we developed a well folded and very photostable variant, SiriusGFP.\\nResults: The fluorescence spectrum indicated that the excitation and emission peaks of SiriusGFP were red shifted by 16 and 8 nm, respectively. Co- operative effects of two key mutations, S147R and S205 V, contribute to its photostability. SiriusGFP tagged to the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Omp25 showed sustained fluorescence during continuous 3D-scanning confocal imaging (4D confocal) compared to eGFP-tagged Omp25. Furthermore, with super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) we demonstrate marked improvements in image quality and resolution (130 nm in XY axis, and 310 nm in Z axis), as well as, decreased artifacts due to photobleaching.\\nComparison with Existing Method(s): Compared to eGFP. SiriusGFP shows a 2-fold increase in photostability in vitro, and folds well when fused to the N- and C- termini of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins. While its quantum yield is (similar to)3 fold lower than eGFP, its decreased brightness was more than compensated by its increased photostability in different experimental paradigms allowing practical experimentation without dynamic adjustment of light intensity or fluorescence sampling times.\\nConclusions: We have developed a variant of eGFP, SiriusGFP, that shows over a two fold increase in photostability with utility in methods requiring sustained or high intensity excitation as in 4D confocal or SIM imaging.\", \"The aim of this study was to develop and validate a LC stability-indicating method for the quantitation of desonide hair lotion currently marketed in Brazil, as well as delineate upon the photostability study of the same pharmaceutical product.

The method satisfied all the validation requirements, evidenced by good linearity (r > 0.9999, in the range from 5 to 100 mu g mL-1), accuracy (recovery average 100.26%), precision (intraday RSD 0.45 and 1.76%; interday RSD 1.23%), robustness and specificity, indicated by good resolution between the analite peak from adjacent peaks (R>2.0) and suitable peak purity index in all the stress conditions. In order to evaluate the photostability of desonide hair lotion and desonide active pharmaceutical ingredient (desonide API), their portions were exposed to UVA light. The degradation of desonide hair lotion 0.1% in the conditions tested can be described by first-order kinetics, with the residual desonide content being around 39% after 15h exposure. The content of desonide API was 96.5%, after 72h exposure. The results indicate the instability of desonide in the evaluated drug product.

Several powder samples containing various amounts of moisture were irradiated with monochromatic light as a scan measurement from 700 to 280 nm, and the heat flow evolved in the photodegradation of nifedipine was determined. According to the results, light does not affect the nifedipine molecule directly, but the photodegradation is a result of the combined effects of moisture and light.\", \"Solid-state samples based on modified polymethyl methacrylate (MPMMA) with methanol doped with the dye pyrromethene 650 (PM650) are prepared. The effects of a volume percentage of methanol on the laser characteristics of the sample, including spectra properties, slope efficiency, photostability and tunable properties, are investigated. The broadband dye laser output wavelength is around 655 nm and a highest slope efficiency of 32.23% is achieved. Pumping the samples at a repetition rate of 5 Hz with a pulse energy of as high as 100 mJ (the fluence is 0.26 J/cm(2)), the longest lifetime (168000 shots) is obtained in the sample (MMA:methanol=18:2), and the corresponding normalized photostability reaches 109.19 GJ/mol.

This oil-soluble filter, which today is widely used in both beach products and skin care products, exhibits inherent photostability and strong broad-spectrum UV-A+B absorbance. Based on the concept of micronized organic UV absorbers, the UV-B filter tris biphenyl triazine (TBPT) will be introduced. At present TBPT exhibits the highest efficacy of all cosmetic UV absorbers in the market (measured by area under the UV spectrum). Finally, the concept of liposomogenic UV absorbers will be featured. This approach was developed to create water-resistant UV filters, as liposomogenic structures are thought to integrate into the lipids of the horny layer.

IT-SLNs were prepared by the hot high pressure homogenization method. Size, zeta potential and morphological characteristics of the preparations were assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and thermotropic properties with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). IT-SLNs had a small average diameter of 74.05 +/- 8.91 nm and high encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 80.6 +/- 1.2 %. The results showed that the entrapment of IT into SLNs reduced significantly its photodegradation. The in vitro permeation data showed that IT-SLNs can accumulate in the different layers of the skin and prevent systemic uptake of IT in mouse skin. IT-SLNs also significantly increased IT accumulation in the different layers of the stratum corneum of human skin. IT-SLN formulation was significantly less irritating compared to commercial IT-GEL, which shows its potential for improving skin tolerability and being a carrier for topical delivery of IT.\", \"Kinetics of photodegradation, half lifes and photodegradation products of two parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (anthracene and chrysene), their methyl-derivatives (9-methylanthracene and 6-methylchrysene) and selected nitro-derivatives (9-nitroanthracene and 6-nitrochrysene) were observed during exposition to UV irradiation in isooctane solutions. Additionally, influence of substituent position on photostability of PAH methyl-derivatives was observed in isooctane solutions. 1-Methylanthracene, 2-methylanthracene, 9-methylanthracene and 1-methylchrysene, 2-methylchrysene, 3-methylchrysene, 4-methylchrysene, 5-methylchrysene, 6-methylchrysene were chosen for the experiment. It was found that the effect of substituent type on photodegradation was very significant, especially in the case of nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Decomposition of nitro-derivatives was easier than degradation of corresponding parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. On the other hand stability of methyl-derivatives was slightly better in comparison with parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The effect of methyl-group position was negligible. The most frequent photoproducts were quinones, benzoic acid and other derivatives with hydroxyl, carbonyl and carboxyl groups for all polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and the derivatives.

In general the presence of an aryl group at C-8 of the pyrromethene chromophore increased the photostability. One of the congeners possessing a C-8 trimethoxyphenyl moiety showed significantly improved lasing parameters than PM567. Compared to PM567, the photochemical stability of the new dye was 2-fold, while it showed an equivalent lasing efficiency to that of PM567 at a significantly lower concentration. The increased photostability of these new dye molecules could be explained by theoretical calculation on their capacity to generate singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) and probability of reaction with O-1(2). Our calculations were in agreement with the experimental results and indicated that a systematic design of new derivatives of pyrromethene chromophore might lead to improved laser dye molecules.\", \"The absorption and fluorescence spectra of three hydroxycoumarins have been determined in anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide, tetrahyrofuran and acetonitrile. Minor absorption and fluorescence bands were observed at slightly longer wavelengths than the principal bands in dimethylsulfoxide. These bands were enhanced in dimethylsulfoxide which has a greater proton affinity than the other solvents studied. However, the minor bands were decreased by the presence of carbon dioxide in solution. These minor bands were ascribed to the deprotonated forms of the hydroxycoumarins with the deprotonation being facilitated by Lewis bases such as dimethylsulfoxide but Suppressed by a Lewis acid such as carbon dioxide because, at the low concentrations of hydroxycoumarin used in this work, the carbon dioxide competes Successfully for the electron pair/proton acceptor sites of the dimethylsulfoxide solvent.\\nThe photostability of esculetin is less than that of scopoletin under UVA irradiation in all solvents studied. Because esculetin is more acidic than scopoletin, this order of photostabilities is consistent with the initial step in the photodegradation involving deprotonation of the hydroxycoumarins.

This replacement is generalizable in other chemical families of fluorophores, such as coumarin, phthalimide, and nitrobenzoxadiazole dyes. In highly polar fluorophores, we show that aziridinyl dyes even outperform their azetidinyl analogues in aqueous solution. We also proposed one simple mechanism that can explain the vulnerability of quantum yield to hydrogen bond interactions in protonic solvents in various fluorophore families.

The complexes showed a water solubility enhancement of approximately 2.6 times; nevertheless, the photodegradation of ofloxacin was not reduced. The complexes obtained were characterized by thermal and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, which revealed an interaction between ofloxacin and beta -cyclodextrin. The last analysis indicated that only partial inclusion of the N-methylpiperazinyl moiety occurred, which can explain the fact that photostabilization was not improved. This partial inclusion phenomenon could be explained also by computer-aided molecular modeling.\", \"Fluorescence-based imaging techniques critically rely on bright and photostable probes for precise detection of biological molecules. Recently, a new class of multichromophoric probes based on fluorescent dendrimer nanoconjugates (FDNs) was developed for single molecule fluorescence microscopy (SMFM). FDNs are generated by covalent conjugation of multiple fluorescent dyes onto macromolecular polymeric scaffolds and show marked increases in brightness and long-term photostability relative to their single organic dye constituents. Multichromophoric probes, however, are generally known to suffer from transient fluorescence emission intensities and long excursions into dark states. To overcome these issues, photostabilizers can be added to bulk solution, though some small molecule additives may exhibit poor aqueous solubility or biological toxicity. In this work, we develop enhanced FDN derivatives by covalently linking a redox-active photostabilizer (Trolox) directly onto FDN molecular scaffolds. In one approach, multiple organic dyes (Cy5) and Trolox molecules are randomly distributed on dendritic scaffolds in tunable stoichiometric amounts, and in a second approach, Cy5 dyes are covalently linked to Trolox in a precise 1:1 stoichiometry followed by covalent attachment of Cy5 Trolox conjugates onto dendrimers. In all cases, FDN Trolox conjugates show increases in photostability, brightness, and reduced fluctuations in transient fluorescent intensity relative to FDN probes. Bulk and single molecule photophysical data for FDN probes are compared to single self-healing dye systems such as Cy5 Trolox, and as a proof-of-principle demonstration, we use FDN Trolox derivatives for bulk immunofluorescence imaging. Overall, our work suggests that self-healed multichromophoric systems such as FDN Trolox probes present a useful strategy for increasing fluorescent probe photostability.\", \"Effects of the photoirradiation period on the progressive degradation and loss in fungal inhibition were investigated to comprehend the photostability of organoiodine wood preservatives.\\nTest solutions of 400 ppm which were prepared with ethanol from four kinds of organoiodine fungicides [4-chlorophenyl-3-iodopropargyl formal (IF-1000), 3-iodo-2-propynyl butyl carbamate (IPBC), 3-bromo-2,3-diiodo-2-propenylethyl carbonate (EBIP), and 2,3,3-triiodoallyl alcohol (TIAA)] were exposed to light irradiation (sunlight and ultraviolet lamps with a wave length of 290 -400 nm). Quantitative gas chromatographic analysis showed that all the preservatives were degradated through photoirradiation. The order of fungicides according to the decomposing rates was TIAA > EBIP > IF-1000 > IPBC. The photostability of IPBC was greater than any other organoidoine preservatives tested. In contrast, TIAA, which originally had great fungicidal efficacy was broken down easily. The amounts of decomposed products reached a peak after 85-110 hours of irradiation. Thereafter, both the derived and the original chemicals decomposed.\\nFungal inhibitory effects of each test solution were lessened after irradiation as demonstrated by the growth of test fungi on the agar medium. The decreasing order of fungal inhibition was EBIP > TIAA > IF-1000 > IPBC.\\nOrganoiodine wood preservatives when immpregnated into wood also were degraded by light exposure, although no remarkable peaks of the decomposed materials were not seen. The order of the recovery rates was IPBC > EBIP = IF-1000 > TIAA. The fact that over 24 days of irradiation resulted in almost constant recovery rates of the fungicides suggested that chemicals immpregnated into wood to some extent would not be decomposed because of the unexposure to light.\", \"The photostability of the beta-blocker drug Atenolol was evaluated at pH 9, 7.4 and 4.0. The drug was exposed to UVA-UVB radiations and the photoproducts were detected by reversed phase LC methods. The photodegradation was found to increase with the pH value decreasing. The major photodegradation product at pH 7.4 was identified as 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamide. The LC method developed for routine analyses (column: C-18 Alltima; mobile phase: TEA acetate (pH 4; 0.01 M)-acetonitrile 96:4) was found to be suitable for the stability - indicating determination of Atenolol in pharmaceutical dosage forms.

The monomeric dyes PnMA have been successfully copolymerized with methyl methacrylate (MMA), yielding linear copolymers of high optical quality where the covalently bonded chromophore is separated from the polymeric main chain by a spacer of variable length. The photostability of the solid polymeric materials under UV (310 run) irradiation (method ASTM G 53-77) has been compared with those of the model dyes PnAc and PM567 as solid solutions in poly-MMA (PnAc-PMMA and PM567-PMMA, respectively). In all the cases, the chromophore bound to the polymer is more photostable than that simply dissolved in the same polymer, with photodegradation quantum yields in the range 2.3x10(-5) to 4.8X10(-5), which was interpreted as due to additional modes for the dissipation of the absorbed energy along the polymeric chain. In both polymer solutions and copolymers, the length of the polymethylene chain has low or null influence on the photostability. In ethanol solution, PnAc model dyes with polymethylene chains with three or more methylene groups show about the same photostability; this is of an order of magnitude higher than that of the parent dyes P1Ac and PM567 in the same solvent.\", \"Boron(III) complexes with alkyl-, phenyl-, and halogen-substituted 2,2 '-dipyrromethenes (BODIPY) and meso-aza-dipyrrometenes (ms-aza-BODIPY) were synthesized. The structure relationship of the obtained coordination compounds with their luminescent characteristics is analyzed. Arylated BODIPY, in contrast to alkyl-substituted analogs, is more sensitive to interparticle interactions with a solvent, causing a decrease in the quantum yield by up to 40%. The introduction of phenyl substituents into the BODIPY molecule shifts the first absorption band bathochromic, significantly (32-37 nm) increases the Stokes shift in the emission spectrum, but reduces the probability of the S-0 -> S-1 electronic transition as compared to alkylated complexes. Replacing the methine carbon atom with nitrogen leads to quenching of ms-aza-BODIPY fluorescence compared to BODIPY up to 5-20%. The stability of 2,2 '-dipyrromethenes difluoroborates to oxidative destruction under the influence of UV irradiation in cyclohexane solutions was evaluated. It has been shown that symmetric aryl substitution in pyrrole cycles of dipyrromethene significantly increases the photostability of the corresponding compounds as compared to alkyl-substituted analogs and is an effective method of obtaining boron (III) dipyrromethenates with practically useful properties. It has been established that the replacement of the methin ms-spacer of dipyrromethene by a nitrogen atom significantly reduces the photostability of ms-aza-dipyrromethenates of boron. Halogenation of beta-positions of pyrrole cycles by a factor of 5-8 reduces the photostability of difluoroborates ms-aza-dipyrromethenes in comparison with a non-halogenated analogue.\", \"The photostability of thiol-capped CdTe quantum dots (QDs) in Euglena gracilis (EG 277) and human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells was studied. The photobleaching for the cellular QDs is dependent both on the irradiation power density and the QD local concentration. The photostability of cellular QDs is better than that of chlorophyll in EG 277 cells and of green fluorescence protein (GFP) in HEK 293 cells, and is much better than that of FITC when the local concentration of QDs is not too low. The photobleaching of cellular QDs was remarkably reduced in the nitrogen treated EG 277 cells, indicating that photobleaching in living cells mainly results from photo-oxidation. The effect of photo-oxidation on QD photobleaching was further confirmed by comparing the situations in oxygen treated and nitrogen treated QD aqueous solutions. The photobleaching rate is related to the irradiation power density and the local density of QDs. The higher irradiation power density and oxygen abundance and lower QD concentration will result in a higher photobleaching rate.\", \"We present here the development of a photochemical model used to quantify the risk to photodegradation of a solid drug substance. A key feature of the proposed model development is streamlined estimation of the dependence of the absorption spectra and the quantum yield to the wavelength. A mathematical description of the relationship between the quantum yield and the wavelength enables estimation of photodegradation kinetics under any light anticipated to be encountered in the manufacturing environment. The system studied here consisted of a first order irreversible transformation (A -> B(1 Phi)) and the formalism strongly suggested the quantum yield was constant over the relevant wavelength range. The predictive power of the model enabled the design of a control strategy to limit the formation of the photo-degradant to very low levels. Also presented are insights obtained from quantum mechanical modeling of the electronic transitions associated with the UV absorption spectra.\", \"Methods to improve the photostability/photon output of fluorophores without compromising their signal stability are of paramount importance in single-molecule fluorescence (SMF) imaging applications. We show herein that Ni2+ provides a suitable photostabilizing agent for three green emissive (Cy3, ATTO532, Alexa532) and three red-emissive (Cy5, Alexa647, ATTO647N) fluorophores, four of which are regularly utilized in SMF studies. Ni2+ works via photophysical quenching of the triplet excited state eliminating the potential for reactive intermediates being formed. Measurements of survival time, average intensity, and mean number of photons collected for the six fluorophores show that Ni2+ increased their photostability 10- to 45-fold, comparable to photochemically based systems, without compromising the signal intensity or stability. Comparative studies with existing photostabilizing strategies enabled us to score different photochemical and photophysical stabilizing systems, based on their intended application. The realization that Ni2+ allowed achieving a significant increase in photon output both for green- and red-emissive fluorophores positions Ni2+ as a widely applicable tool to mitigate photobleaching, most suitable for multicolor single-molecule fluorescence studies.\", \"Thiol-capped CdSe/CdS core/shell nanocrystals (NCs) which show high luminescence quantum yield are synthesized in an aqueous solution. UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy are employed to analyze optical characters and stabilities of NCs. Furthermore, PL properties are studied in a temperature range between 77K and 300K. The PL peak position of bare CdSe NCs shifts toward shorter wavelengths and the band becomes sharper with decreasing temperature. On the same condition, the PL peak position of CdSe/CdS core/shell NCs keeps unconverted nearly with the variation of temperature. Photostability of bare CdSe NCs and CdSe/CdS core/shell NCs are compared under the 325nm laser irradiation. It takes 78 seconds that the PL intensity declines to the half for CdSe NCs, but 442 seconds for CdSe/CdS core/shell NCs. The fluorescence decay lifetime increases about six times after overcoating. The results indicate that the CdS shell can improve the low temperature PL stability and photostability of CdSe NCs effectively.\", \"Biologically active photosensitizers with long absorption wavelength are among the new generation drugs for potential application in photodynamic therapy (PDT). This study presents a new phthalocyanine photosensitizer functionalized with amino acid for application in PDT. This photosensitizer, tetra-(4-tyrosylamido) phenoxy substituted zinc(II) phthalocyanine (ZnPcTyr), was synthesized and chemically characterized. The properties of electronic absorption, fluorescence, photostability, and singlet oxygen generation were studied. The obtained photophysicochemical characteristics suggested that this newly synthesized tyrosine conjugated zinc(II) phthalocyanine has promising potential as photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy.

The as-prepared nanorods exhibit low toxicity to living cells and excellent photostability. Furthermore, they are stable in solutions of various pHs and high ionic strength and in solutions with interfering metal ions. Compared with the free DPP-Br molecules in THF, these nanorods exhibit larger Stokes shift, broader absorption spectra, and greatly improved photostability. We successfully demonstrated the application of the nanorods, including their aforementioned beneficial characteristics, as a good fluorescence probe for bio-imaging.\", \"Skin exposure to acute or repetitive ultraviolet light induces risks which are now well identified. An efficient photoprotection is thus required for both UVB and UVA radiation. In particular, increasing evidence of the detrimental effects of UVA on skin has led to the development of a new generation of sunscreens that provide effective protection throughout the whole UV radiation spectrum. Many new UV filters have been introduced in the last decade, particularly UVA filters, with improved efficacy and safety. Sunscreen filters must be carefully combined to achieve esthetically pleasing products offering photostable and well-balanced photoprotection.\", \"Rutin is a flavonoid and has found a wide application in the treatment of various chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. The pharmaceutical application of rutin is limited due to its poor water solubility. One of the ways to enhance the solubility and stability is the formation of the inclusion complexes. The purpose of this study was to improve the solubility, antioxidative activity and photostability of rutin by preparation of the inclusion complexes with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) and (2-hydroxypropyl)-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD). The inclusion complexes were structurally characterized using FT-IR, XRD, H-1 NMR methods. The obtained results indicated that the complexation between rutin and cyclodextrins were successfully achieved in the mixture of ethanol and water 2:3 (v/v) at room temperature for 24 h. The study of phase-solubility was showed that the solubility of rutin was linearly increased in the solution of increasing amount of cyclodextrins, i.e. that the molar ratio was 1:1 in the complexes. The calculated values of stability constants were found to be 508.4 and 488.9 M-1 for rutin:beta-CD and rutin:HP-beta-CD complexes, respectively. After preparation of inclusion complexes, the antioxidant activity of rutin was improved due to the increase of its scavenge capacity. The photostability study indicates that the complexed rutin was a more stable and protected from the effect of irradiation in compared with free rutin. The improvement in the physicochemical properties provide the opportunities to the inclusion complexes of rutin to use for design of the new pharmaceutical products with modified characteristics of active substance.\", \"The technical performance of five selected commercial photochromic dyes applied by screen-printing on textiles was evaluated using a colour measurement methodology that has previously been established and validated. The results of wash fastness assessments were distinctly unusual. With the selected spirooxazine dyes, the degree of photocoloration increased with initial washing and decreased with subsequent washings, while the naphthopyrans behaved more normally, showing a consistent marginal decrease in photocoloration with repeated washing. An explanation is proposed consistent with scanning electron microscopy examination of the binder film degradation and with the structural differences between the dye classes. The dyes in this application showed limited photostability. The incorporation of ultraviolet absorbers was found to increase photostability only to an extent specific to particular ultraviolet absorber/dye combinations. However, the presence of the ultraviolet absorber led to a consistent reduction in the degree of photocoloration of the dyes. In contrast, the incorporation of hindered amine light stabilisers significantly enhanced the photostability of the dyes, providing an increase in resistance to photodegradation of up to fivefold.\", \"Theoretical and experimental studies of molecular photodegradation in pi-conjugated chromophores with resonant and nonresonant excitation relative to the lowest-energy electronic transition of the chromophore are performed. The limitations of previous photodegradation models are discussed, and new models that overcome these limitations and provide more accurate estimates of chromophore photostability are presented. In particular, the necessity of considering multiple degradation pathways in the analysis of photobleaching studies is shown. Photostability studies of a dihydrofuran thiophene-bridged dicyanomethylene based chromophore (FTC) employing 1.55-mu m excitation reveal that the photoinitiated decay kinetics are biphasic. We present what we believe to be a new, double-pathway photodegradation model capable of describing this behavior. Through investigations employing the singlet-oxygen quencher bis(dithiobenzil)nickel, photooxidation is shown to be one of the photodegradation pathways, and the ability of a quencher to inhibit chromophore photooxidation. is quantified. The studies presented here provide insight into the mechanism of photochemical degradation of pi-conjugated chromophores for devices operating in the visible and at telecommunication wavelengths.

The excited-singlet state lifetime, measured by time-correlated single photon counting, was 0.4 ns. Laser flash photolysis experiments at 355 nm did not show any transient species. The triplet state of porphyra-334 was sensitized by triplet-triplet energy transfer. The T-T absorption spectrum was determined and the maximal absorption coefficient at 440 nm was estimated to be 1X10(4) M-1 cm(-1). in this way an upper Limit for the intersystem crossing quantum yield was determined. The very low quantum yield of fluorescence (Phi (F)=0.0016) and triplet formation (Phi (T)<0.05) together with a photodecomposition quantum yield of 2-4X10(-4), in the absence and the presence of oxygen respectively, can be explained by a very fast internal conversion process. These results support the photoprotective role assigned to this MAA in living systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

The RPD: composite glass laser intensity decayed to 50% of its initial value after approximately 20,000 pump pulses of 13 mJ/pulse. The output of RPD:ormosil glass and RPD:PMMA glass lasers decayed to 50% of their initial value after 1,200 and 1,000 pump pulses of the same energy, respectively. For rhodamine-6G:silica-gel and rhodamine-6G:ormosil glass lasers, the 50% decay occurred already after 1,000 and 300 pulses, respectively. The decay was non-exponential, suggesting that the dye bleaching was not a single-photon process. The average laser output decay rates increased linearly with the pump energy.\\nSinglet-singlet excited state absorption of the RPD dye in the solid matrices was also measured between 550 and 730 nm. At approximately 600 nm the cross section was approximately 2 x 10(-16) cm2/molecule. The excited-state absorption competes with the lasing, and is a main factor that limits the laser efficiency.\", \"Solvent additives are indispensable to achieve highly efficient organic solar cells. The additive residue is unavoidable especially when the devices are prepared at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. In this paper, we introduce 1,10-diiododecane (DID) as the additive, which has high boiling point, and investigate the effects of additive residue on the photodegradation of organic materials and photoelectric properties of solar cells after light illumination. The iodine from the residue of DID in the active layer could be confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) measurements. Structural changes in the films upon illumination are probed using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR). The residual DID is found to dramatically decrease the photostability of the active layer and device performance under light illumination compared with those without additive residue, which are exemplified in current densityevoltage (J-V) and electrochemical impedance measurements. Furthermore, the absorption of the film with additive residue is unchanged after light illumination, indicating that the conjugation of the polymer is not affected by the residue.

The spectral characteristics, singlet oxygen generation ability, luminescence efficiency, and photostability of these photosensitizers are studied upon irradiation by light-emitting diode arrays in different spectral ranges. The ability of photosensitizers to generate singlet oxygen was estimated with the use of tryptophan as a chemical trap. The photostability was estimated by a change in the optical density of solutions in the Soret band after irradiation. It is shown that the photodynamic properties are related to the specific features of the optical absorption spectrum of the material. The results of this work testify to the possibility of using the Dimegin photosensitizer as an efficient drug for photodynamic therapy and fluorescent diagnostics. Comparative studies of luminescence, singlet oxygen generation, and photostability have shown that Dimegin surpasses Photoditazine and Radachlorin in many characteristics. In the future, these studies will help to choose the most efficient irradiation sources for photodynamic therapy and fluorescent diagnostic.\", \"YVO4:Bi3+,Eu3+ nanophosphor is prepared from sodium orthovanadate and nitrates of yttrium, bismuth, and europium in a polyol solvent of diethylene glycol at 160 degrees C. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the nanophosphor is enhanced by a factor of 3.3 after silica coating via reverse micelle method. The gradual increase in the PL intensity is observed under the continuous excitation irrespective of silica coating. This increase in the PL intensity is attributed to the photooxidation of V4+ to V5+, as confirmed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Finally, a highly luminescent and photostable nanophosphor can be prepared by combination of photooxidation pre-treatment and silica coating.\", \"Spectral properties and photostability of the 5,5'-6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1'-dioctyl-3,3'-bis-(3-carboxypropyl)-benzimidacarbocyanine (Dye 1) J-aggregate was investigated in solution and upon adsorption on TiO2 nano-particles. Dye 1 was found to photodegrade on the surface of TiO2. Additionally, the self-assembly of Dye 1 was studied on a glass surface by non-contact atomic force microscopy (NCAFM). The dye molecules form a well-defined fiber like structure that extends for tens of micrometers. The internal structure of the fibers was clearly resolved and showed a number of small tubes wrapped around each other to form a helical structure.\", \"Four novel pentamethine cyanines have been investigated for their photophysical behaviors and photochemical stability in Nafion-Na+ membranes. The incorporation processes of these dyes into Nafion membranes are diffusion-controlled and the apparent diffusion constants have been determined. Fluorescence quantum yields and fluorescence lifetimes of all tested dyes in Nation membranes have been determined and significant fluorescence enhancements were observed with respect to their fluorescence in aqueous solution. Photolysis of these dyes suggested these dye molecules are stabilized significantly by Nafion membranes. Furthermore, the fluorescence enhancements and the photostabilization of these dyes are more significant in dry Nafion membranes than those in wet ones.\", \"In comparison with the hybridization with 0D TiO2 nanoparticle, 2D layered TiO2 nanosheets are much more effective in the improvement of the photocatalytic activity and photostability of semiconducting compounds. The 2D TiO2-Ag3PO4 nanohybrid described in this paper shows a greater decrease in the electron-hole recombination upon hybridization and a stronger chemical interaction between the components than the 0D homologue. This result confirms the benefits of 2D layered TiO2 nanosheets as a building block for efficient hybrid-type photocatalyst materials.\", \"Bright, long-lasting organic fluorophores enable a broad range of imaging applications. \\\"Self-healing\\\" fluorophores, in which intra-molecularly linked protective agents quench photo-induced reactive species, exhibit both enhanced photostability and biological compatibility. However, the self-healing strategy has yet to achieve its predicted potential, particularly in the presence of ambient oxygen where live-cell imaging studies must often be performed. To identify key bottlenecks in this technology that can be used to guide further engineering developments, we synthesized a series of Cy5 derivatives linked to the protective agent cyclooctatetraene (COT) and examined the photophysical mechanisms curtailing their performance. The data obtained reveal that the photostability of self-healing fluorophores is limited by reactivity of the COT protective agent. The addition of electron withdrawing substituents to COT reduced its susceptibility to reactions with molecular oxygen and the fluorophore to which it is attached and increased its capacity to participate in triplet energy transfer. Exploiting these insights, we designed and synthesized a suite of modified COT-fluorophores spanning the visible spectrum that exhibited markedly increased intra-molecular photostabilization. Under ambient oxygen conditions, the photostability of Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophore derivatives increased by 3-and 9-fold in vitro and by 2-and 6-fold in living cells, respectively. We further show that this approach can improve a silicon rhodamine fluorophore. These findings offer a clear strategy for achieving the full potential of the self-healing approach and its application to the gamut of fluorophore species commonly used for biomedical imaging.\", \"We have developed a novel fluorescent indicator for NO, DAR-M, which features long-wavelength excitation, high photostability and no pH dependency over a wide pH range.

The extent and rate of photodegradation was determined and compared with the degradation of light-protected solutions. The drug content in the solutions was measured by HPLC.

We demonstrate that the introduction of 2 as a Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) acceptor not only enhances the photostability and emission efficiency compared to individual 1 nanofibers but also induces different binding interactions between analytes and 12 coassembled nanofibers and thereby distinct fluorescence quenching behaviors used for the discrimination of nerve agent and sulfur mustard simulants. Our findings represent an important advance toward sensitive detection and discrimination of chemical warfare agents (CWAs).\", \"Tracking the dynamics of mitochondrial morphology has attracted much research interest because of its involvement in early stage apoptosis and degenerative conditions. To follow this process, highly specific and photostable fluorescent probes are in demand. Commercially available mitochondria trackers, however, suffer from poor photostability. To overcome this limitation, we have designed and synthesized a fluorescent agent, tetraphenylethene-triphenylphosphonium (TPE-TPP), for mitochondrial imaging. Inherent from the mitochondrial-targeting ability of TPP groups and the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics of the TPE core, TPE-TPP possesses high specificity to mitochondria, superior photostability, and appreciable tolerance to environmental change, allowing imaging and tracking of the mitochondrial morphological changes in a long period of time.\", \"The synthesis and photophysical properties of water-soluble, fluorescent polyglycerol-dendronized perylenediimides 14 are reported. The polyglycerol dendrons, which are known to be highly biocompatible, are found to confer high water-solubility on the perylenediimide in aqueous media while retaining its excellent fluorescent properties. Furthermore, intramolecular crosslinking of the polyglycerol dendrons using the ring-closing metathesis reaction not only enhances the photostability but also reduces the size of perylenediimide-cored dendrimers. The permeability of the various dendritic shells is probed using heavy metal ion quenchers and compared to non-dendritic but water-soluble perylenediimide 5.\", \"Bright fluorophores in the near-infrared and shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum are essential for optical imaging invivo. In this work, we utilized a 7-dimethylamino flavylium heterocycle to construct a panel of novel red-shifted polymethine dyes, with emission wavelengths from 680 to 1045nm. Photophysical characterization revealed that the 1- and 3-methine dyes display enhanced photostability and the 5- and 7-methine dyes exhibit exceptional brightness for their respective spectral regions. A micelle formulation of the 7-methine facilitated SWIR imaging in mice.

Efforts were focused on high purity rebaudioside A (>97% by HPLC), commonly known as rebiana. In the course of the development program, extensive stability studies were carried out on rebiana, all supporting good stability for use in all food and beverage applications, including conditions where rebiana-sweetened beverages were exposed to light. Our findings on rebiana light stability refute those of an earlier study that suggested rebaudioside A to be unstable to sunlight exposure, while the structurally homologous stevioside is stable. We replicated the earlier study and found no significant photodegradation for either rebaudioside A or stevioside.\", \"With the goal to improve their photostability, InP-based QDs are passivated with three types of inorganic shells, namely (i) a gradient ZnSexS1-x shell, (ii) an additional ZnS shell on top of the gradient shell with two different thicknesses (core/shell/shell, CSS), (iii) an alumina coating on top of ZnS. All three systems have photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) > 50% and similar PL decay times (64-67 ns). To assess their photostability they are incorporated into a transparent poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix and exposed to continuous irradiation with simulated sunlight in a climate chamber. The alumina coated core/shell system exhibits the highest stability in terms of PLQY retention as well as the lowest shift of the PL maximum and lowest increase of the PL linewidth, followed by the CSS QDs and finally the gradient shell system. By means of XPS studies we identify the degradation of the ZnS outer layer and concomitant oxidation of the emissive InZnP core as the main origins of degradation in the gradient structure. These modifications do not occur in the case of the alumina-capped sample, which exhibits excellent chemical stability. The gradient shell and CSS systems could be transferred to the aqueous phase using surface ligand exchange with penicillamine. Cytotoxicity studies on human primary keratinocytes revealed that exposure for 24 h to 6.25-100 nM of QDs did not affect cell viability. However, a trend toward reduced cell proliferation is observed for higher concentrations of gradient shell and CSS QDs with a thin ZnS shell, while CSS QDs with a thicker ZnS shell do not exhibit any impact.\", \"Cation-pi interactions such as Lys(+)-Trp, are highly abundant structural motifs in proteins. Both, experimental and theoretical studies of small prototypical gas phase systems, H(+)Trp, H(+)Trp center dot(H2O)(n) and H+ Gly-Trp, indicate such an arrangement as potential hot spot for photodamage and photoinstability. Here, we study the photodynamical properties of a Lys(+)-Trp pair in the protein human serum albumin (HSA) using nonadiabatic mixed time-dependent density functional theory / molecular mechanics simulations (TDDFT/MM). These simulations show that the findings for small protonated Trp complexes are largely transferable to a more complex protein environment. Under partially hydrated (\\\"dry\\\" conditions), when the -NH3+ head group is not fully solvated, photoexcitation of the tryptophan leads indeed to rapid photodissociation of the proximal charged amino group. In contrast, photostability is well maintained under fully solvated conditions when the lysine head group is fully hydrogen-bonded. In this case, photodynamics takes place in a pi-pi* state without interference of fast dissociative sigma(C-N)* or sigma(N-H)* channels. These results highlight the crucial role of hydrogen bonds in ensuring the photostability of essential biological building blocks.\", \"The photostability of selected benzocycloheptane antihistaminic agents, namely, loratadine (I), pizotifen (II), ketotifen fumarate (M)and cyproheptatidine (IV), was investigated. Both I and II were photolabile while HI and IV were photostable. To perform stability studies on the photolabile compounds (I and II), specific stability-indicating high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) methods were estabfished. The accuracy, precision and reliability of the developed HPLC methods for the assay of I and II in their pharmaccutical dosage forms were reported. Assay results for both drugs were within R.S.D. values <2%. The stability-indicating power of the developed methods was validated through study of UV-degraded solutions of I and II contained in quartz cells. The photostability of both drugs was studied under UN-irradiation at 254 nm. The photodegradation kinetics of both drugs, studied in different solvents, are also reported.

The LDHs were of the hydrotalcite (Mg-Al-OH and Zn-Al-OH compositions). During synthesis of the hydrocalumite type (Ca-Al-OH), partial destruction of the dye occurs, being more pronounced at higher pH values. The composites were characterized with regard to their composition by elemental and thermal analysis. From UV-vis spectroscopic data and powder X-ray diffraction, a structural model is developed for the composites. In the galleries between the hydroxide layers, the chromophore molecules are stacked in an J-type arrangement. The compounds have brilliant colors and are insoluble in common solvents. With regard to a possible application as pigments, their photostability and their chemical resistance against a typical application environment was tested. The photostability of the dye molecules and their chemical resistance against setting cement are slightly raised by the occlusion within the LDH structure, however, the photostability of the LDH-cement is lower than that of cement with the pure perylene dye.\", \"We study the impact of excitation energy on the photostability of methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPI) perovskite thin films. Light soaking leads to a transient increase of the photoluminescence efficiency at excitation wavelengths longer than 520 nm, whereas light-induced degradation occurs when exciting the films with wavelengths shorter than 520 nm. X-ray diffraction and extinction measurements reveal the light-induced decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 to lead iodide (PbI2) for the high-energy excitation regime. We propose a model explaining the energy dependence of the photostability that involves the photoexcitation of residual PbI2 species in the perovskite triggering the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3.\", \"We present ground and excited state properties of silylated coumarin dyes. We have calculated the energies and dipole moments of ground and excited states of silylated coumarins and some coumarin derivatives. Using CIS we find a good agreement with experimental S(0) -> S(1) excitation energies. Silylation of dye molecules had minor effect on the transition energies. On the basis of theoretical results, we conclude that silylated dye will have improved long-term photostability compared to its unsilylated counterpart due to its covalent bonding with the host matrix.

The synthesis procedure involved hydrolysis of TiCl4, acid treatment, and a SiO2 surface-modifying process. Before surface modification, the TiO2 suspension was treated with acid to remove Na ions, soluble TiO2, and other impurities. The acid treatment of a TiO2 suspension at a higher temperature was proved to be useful for effective SiO2 modification. The colloidal sol provided high transparency in visible light as well as excellent UV-shielding properties. Surface modification of TiO2 particles with SiO2 greatly improved both the dispersing stability in neutral pH and the photostability of TiO2 colloidal sol.\", \"Luminescent carbon-based materials have been prepared by electrostatic self-assembly of negatively-charged luminescent Eu(III)-complex with imidazolium-functionalized MWCNTs.\", \"The inorganic thin-film fluorescence probe, with the advantages of long life span and high sensitivity, has attracted much attention in explosive detection. The poor ultraviolet absorption and lack of an aromatic ring make peroxide-based explosives very hard to detect. As the signature compound of peroxide-based explosives, H2O2 vapor detection became more and more important. Rare-earth-doped vanadate is considered to be a suitable material for the detection of hydrogen peroxide due to the quenching of its fluorescence in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Its only drawback lies on its poor photostability. In this work, we have developed a new synthesis to limit the photobleaching of EuVO4-based films. We propose herein an original protocol using microwave-assisted sol-gel route. The photostability of luminescent EuVO4 has been achieved and the sensitivity has been greatly increased. The detection limit for H2O2 vapor is as low as 100 parts per billion (ppb). The characterization of these nanoparticles by photoelectron spectroscopy clearly correlates their sensitivity to H2O2 to the surface chemistry.\\n[GRAPHICS]\", \"Aqueous suspensions containing increasing amounts (0.1-200 g/L) of egg white at different ionic strength (0.025-1.000 M NaCl) were characterised for critical concentration associated to self crowding phenomena. Samples were then exposed to 30 W m(- 2) UV-C light for 10 min. Self crowded proteins resulted fully resistant to photodegradation. In uncrowded conditions, egg white underwent fragmentation and aggregation. The increase in ionic strength favoured protein folding. Compact proteins were more prone to intramolecular rearrangement and reached photostability at higher concentrations. Self crowding could be selectively exploited to steer protein resistance to physical stresses.\", \"A facile, green, and high-output hydrothermal synthesis was proposed for the fabrication of highly fluorescent nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (N-doped CDs). The nitrogen content in N-doped CDs reached 19.2% and demonstrated strong blue fluorescence emission was obtained with fluorescence quantum yield (QY) of up to 32.9%, which exhibit high fluorescence quantum yield, high photostability, and excellent biocompatibility. The N-doped CDs possess high photostability, low toxicity, and excellent biocompatibility, based on which the N-doped CDs were successfully applied as a fluorescence probe for cell imaging.

Homologous C-, O-, and N-functionalized subclasses are accessed in a straightforward manner with a wide substrate scope. These chemoselective branching events are driven by Pd-catalyzed ortho-selective C-H activation at the pendant aryl ring and base-promoted reactivity modulation of the amide group, leveraging the intrinsic directing capability and competing pronucleophilicity of the quinazolin-4(3H)-one framework. Furthermore, outstanding photostability of the quinazolin-4(3H)-one family associated with nonradiative decay is presented.\", \"Metallo-meso-5,10,15,20-tetrakis-(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrins (metallo-TPPSs), such as ZnTPPS, have been widely used as photosensitizers. However, their vulnerability to photodegradation significantly limits their applications. In this contribution, we demonstrate a method to enhance the photostability of metallo-TPPSs while retaining photoactivity via encapsulation inside cores of complex micelles. Poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PEG-b-P4VP) and metallo-TPPSs can form complex micelles in acidic solution through electrostatic interactions and then undergo axial coordination with the pyridine moieties of PEG-b-P4VP when the pH is adjusted to 7.4. In this way, metallo-TPPSs are entrapped in the hydrophobic, compact micellar cores, which effectively prevents photodegradation of the metallo-TPPSs that would otherwise occur in aqueous solution. In addition, the photodebromination of 2,3-dibromo-3-phenylpropionic acid (DPP) sensitized with ZnTPPS has been used as a model reaction to study the photosensitive activity of ZnTPPS entrapped in complex micelles. The entrapped ZnTPPSs exhibit pronounced activity and have much higher efficiency and faster photosensitive reaction rates than free ZnTPPS. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Three low band gap alternating D-A copolymers consisting of 3-fluoro-2-heptylcarbonylthieno[3,4-b]thiophene and alkyl-substituted BDT, alkoxy-substituted BDT, or dithienosilole, respectively, were prepared for investigating their photovoltaic performance and photostability. After only two hours of simultaneous exposure to light and air, the main absorption peak of the polymer films containing BDT units blue-shifted and its intensity dramatically decreased. We demonstrated that the BDT unit underwent dramatic structural change under illumination in air by reacting with the oxygen molecules at the excited state, leading to the disruption of the main-chain conjugation of the polymer. As a result, the color of the alkyl-BDT based polymer film permanently changed from deep blue to light yellow. In contrast, the dithienosilole based polymer was quite stable when treated under the same condition with negligible change in the absorption spectrum.\", \"The self-assembly behavior, spectroscopic properties and stability of C.I. Basic Violet 10 (Rhodamine B) were investigated at a relatively high concentration.

This tag is composed of previously published fluorogen-activating protein FAST and a novel fluorogenic derivative of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-like chromophore with red fluorescence. The reversible binding of the novel fluorogen and FAST is accompanied by three orders of magnitude increase in red fluorescence (580-650 nm). The proposed dye instantly stains target cellular proteins fused with FAST, washes out in a minute timescale, and exhibits higher photostability of the fluorescence signal in confocal and widefield microscopy, in contrast with previously published fluorogen:FAST complexes.\", \"A core-shell composite consisting of polypyrrole (PPy) coating on Au nanorods with high two-photon photothermal efficiency and good photostability have been fabricated via a facile interfacial polymerization. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the core-shell structure of the uniform Au-PPy nanorods. The core-shell composites exhibited improved temperature elevation and photostability compared to pure Au nanorods. The composites internalized by cancer cells can be detected by strong two-photon fluorescence, thus minimizing photothermal damage to normal tissues. The cell cytotoxicity and two-photon efficiency experiments in vitro demonstrate that the composites of Au-PPy nanorods have high efficiency to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells.\", \"The interaction between electromagnetic radiation and bio-molecules in heterogeneous environments is a prebiotically relevant process. Minerals may have a pivotal role in the prebiotic evolution of complex chemical systems, mediating the effects of electromagnetic radiation, influencing the photostability of bio-molecules, catalyzing important chemical reactions and/or protecting molecules against degradation. In particular, nucleobases are relevant bio-molecules to investigate both in the prebiotic context, because they are coding components of nucleic acids, and from the standpoint of the survival of biological systems in space conditions. Several studies on the photodynamics of nucleobases suggest that their structure could have been naturally selected for the ability to dissipate electronic energy through ultrafast photophysical decay. Considering the putative involvement of minerals in the prebiotic chemistry, it is necessary to study the photostability of nucleobases under space conditions in the presence of mineral matrices, to investigate both the prebiotic processes that might have had a role in the development of the first living entities on Earth and the physical and chemical processes occurring in extraterrestrial environments. We focused our study on the characterization of the nature of the interaction between nucleobases and the surface of the minerals magnesium oxide and forsterite by infrared vibrational spectroscopy. We observed that most of the characteristic bands of pure nucleobases vanished when adsorbed on magnesium oxide. On the contrary, in the case of adenine and uracil adsorbed on forsterite, very intense nucleobase absorption peaks appeared. This phenomenon pertains to the surface selection rules changes related to molecular orientation. Moreover, based on the vibrational shifts, we deduced the molecular interaction sites with the mineral surfaces. Furthermore, we investigated the photostability of nucleobases adsorbed on such minerals through in situ UV irradiation experiments. Experimental results confirm the high intrinsic photostability of such molecules, because a rather low probability of interaction between UV radiation and nucleobases was estimated, and furthermore indicate that cytosine and hypoxanthine have a greater photostability compared to adenine and uracil, both pure and adsorbed onto magnesium oxide and forsterite.

Especially ephedrine and pseudoephedrine as chiral auxiliaries with two asymmetric C atoms offer functional groups of divergent reactivity. Dopants prepared by acylation with promesogenic agents can be used in various electro-optic devices. A specific utilization concerns bistable cholesteric liquid crystal displays with stacked double layer construction in order to enhance the luminance of reflected light. Further, the solubility in nematic mixtures, the long term phase behavior, the dopant's impact on textures and phase behavior, the electro-optic response and the photostability of cholesteric mixtures have been investigated.\", \"The problems of photoinitiator contamination are addressed for the liquid crystal phase in polymer dispersed liquid crystal films formed by photopolymerization induced phase separation of liquid crystal from monomer solutions. Initiator contamination lowers the clearing point of the liquid crystal phase, and decreases the photostability and resistivity of the polymer dispersed liquid crystal. These problems are minimized by replacing the conventional photoinitiators with copolymerizable initiators which become incorporated in the polymer phase as it separates. Copolymerizable photoinitiators are studied and used to form polymer dispersed liquid crystals with higher clearing point liquid crystal phases, higher resistivity, and better photostability than polymer dispersed liquid crystals formed with conventional photoinitiators. These improvements provide very significant advantages for many polymer dispersed liquid crystal applications.\", \"We report a rationale for identifying superior dyes for stimulated-emission depletion (STED) microscopy. We compared the dyes pPDI and pTDI, which displayed excellent photostability in single-molecule spectroscopy. Surprisingly, their photostability and performance in STED microscopy differed significantly. While single pTDI molecules could be visualized with excellent resolution (35 nm), pPDI molecules bleached rapidly under similar conditions. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements proved that the overlap between the stimulated-emission band and the excited-state absorption band is the main reason for the observed difference. Thus, assessment of the excited-state absorption band provides a rational means of dye selection and determination of the optimal wavelength for STED.\", \"Intercalation compounds of ZnAl-hydrotalcite with the UV absorber 5-benzoyl-4-hydroxy-2-methoxy-benzenesulphonate acid (4BHF) have been prepared by ion exchange procedure and used to obtain sunscreen stabilization for new cosmetic formulations.

This fluorescein variant has two readily accessible functional groups (aniline NH2 and phenol OH) that can be activated or blocked independently and can serve, for instance, as a fluorescent bridge between two different recognition motifs.

The quantum yield values were observed to fluctuate with time, eventually settling on relatively stable values after 8 weeks. The samples which used only formamide as the initial solvent resulted in the material with the highest quantum yield values. The changing values of the emission wavelength maximum and the quantum yields indicated a hydrogen bond between the dye and the silicate network, i.e., silanols.\", \"Despite expansion of the fluorescent protein and optical highlighter palette into the orange to far-red range of the visible spectrum, achieving performance equivalent to that of EGFP has continued to elude protein engineers.\", \"Cyanobacteria (Cyb), an environment waste, was first utilized as a carrier for controlled release of avermectin (Av) and improvement of pesticide photostability. Microalgae powder prepared from Cyb blooms was characterized by elemental analysis (EA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), infrared spectroscopy (IR), optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The globular morphology and the size (similar to 3.5 mu m) of Cyb do not change significantly, with increase of roughness, after Av adsorption and Carbopol coating. Av manifests considerable binding affinity to Cyb in isopropanol and adsorption decreases in more polar solvents at 25 degrees C. An extended release of Av from Cyb-Av in ethanol/water (v/v, 4:1) mixture was obtained and the release was further controlled by the Carbopol resin coated on Cyb-Av. Thicker Carbopol coating results in larger lag time (t(0)), slower release rate, and less total release amount. The release process was found to be controlled by a diffusion mechanism, but was strongly affected by polymer matrix-Av interaction and polymer relaxation. Finally, adsorbed Av on Cyb exhibits much greater UV-stability than free Av.

The quantum yield of photoreactions (Phi) was determined for various oxygen concentrations in the solvent (CH(2)Cl(2)) and various irradiation wavelengths. Trans-cis photoisomerization is proposed as a photobleaching mechanism during irradiation at longer wavelength due to charge-transfer transitions. Solution deoxygenation led to an unusual decrease in the photostability of the compounds investigated, most likely because of cation radical formation. The population of higher excited states for short-wavelength irradiation opened another degradation pathway and the overall degradation percentage decreased in comparison with long-wavelength irradiation. We assume that photoisomerization of the second double bond and electron transfer to CH(2)Cl(2) (and subsequent oxidation reactions) contribute to this slower degradation branch. Singlet oxygen contributes significantly, albeit to the smallest values of Phi, to the overall photodegradation for both types of irradiation. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Photoproducts are not formed in the solutions of the less photostable sensitizer chlorin e(6) and the most photostable sensitizer aluminium phthalocyanine tetrasulphonate. Interaction with photooxidizible biomolecules increases the photobleaching rate of porphyrin-type sensitizers. This should be taken into account in the estimation of optimal photodynamic doses.

Yet, the stability of the perovskites under various application conditions, and in particular combined light and heat stress, is not well studied. Here, FA(0.15)Cs(0.85)Pb(I0.73Br0.27)(3), with an optical bandgap of approximate to 1.72 eV, is used as a model system to investigate the thermal-photostability of wide-bandgap mixed halide perovskites. It is found that the concerted effect of heat and light can induce both phase segregation and decomposition in a pristine perovskite film. On the other hand, through a postdeposition film treatment with benzylamine (BA) molecules, the highly defective regions (e.g., film surface and grain boundaries) of the film can be well passivated, thus preventing the progression of decomposition or phase segregation in the film. Besides the stability improvement, the BA-modified perovskite solar cells also exhibit excellent photovoltaic performance, with the champion device reaching a power conversion efficiency of 18.1%, a stabilized power output efficiency of 17.1% and an open-circuit voltage (V-oc) of 1.24 V.\", \"The intermolecular triplet-triplet energy transfer from a photounstable UV-A absorber, 4-tert-buty1-4'-methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMDBM), to UV-B absorbers, 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate (octyl methoxycinnamate, OMC), octocrylene (OCR) and diocty14-methoxybenzylidenemalonate (DOMBM) has been observed using a 355 nm laser excitation in rigid solutions at 77 K. The decay curves of the energy-donor phosphorescence in the presence of the UV-B absorbers deviate from the exponential decay at the initial stage of the decay. The Stern-Volmer formulation is not valid in rigid solutions because molecular diffusion is impossible. The experimental results indicate that the rate constant of triplet-triplet energy transfer from BMDBM to the UV-B absorbers, k(T-T), decreases in the following order: k(T-T) (BMDBM-DOMBM) > k(T-T) (BMDBM-OMC) >= k(T-T) (BMDBM-OCR). The presence of DOMBM enhances the photostability of the widely used combination of UV-A and UV-B absorbers, BMDBM and OCR.

The mechanisms proposed to explain the gas phase abundance of interstellar acetone are based on grain mantle chemistry. High energy photons coming from the stellar radiation field of the nearby stars interact with the ice mantles on dust grains leading to photoionization, photodissociation, and photodesorption processes. In this work we investigate the photodesorption and the photostability of pure acetone ices due to soft X-ray impact. Absolute desorption yields per photon impact for the main positive ionic fragments were determined at the O Is resonance energy (531.4 eV). The photostability of acetone ice was studied by exposure to different irradiation doses with a white beam of synchrotron radiation. The degradation of the ice was monitored by NEXAFS around the O Is threshold. From this study we determine the photodissociation cross-section to be about 1.5 X 10(-17) cm(2) which allowed us to estimate the half-life for acetone ice in astrophysical environments where soft X-rays play an important role in chemical processes.\", \"With the purpose of enhancing the biopharmaceutical properties of the furosemide, a pharmaceutical salt was obtained and characterized by combining the drug and triethanolamine. The solid system was prepared using different techniques such as kneading, grinding, and slow evaporation. It was characterizated by X-ray powder diffraction, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that the same pharmaceutical compound in solid state was obtained through the different preparation techniques. The crystalline structure was fully elucidated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The salt formation was confirmed by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, which revealed the transference of the OH proton of the drug to triethanolamine. Besides, the solubility studies demonstrated an increase in the drug solubility attributed not only to a pH change but also to a soluble salt formation in solution. In addition, the combination of the drug with triethanolamine produces an enhancement of the chemical photostability, whereas the physical photostability and the hygroscopicity status were not modified. Finally, this new solid form of furosemide constitutes an interesting strategy to improve the biopharmaceutical properties and stability of furosemide, with potential application in pharmaceutical formulations.\", \"Currently, the stability issue of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is one of the most critical obstacles in the commercialization of PSCs. Although incredible advances in the photovoltaic efficiencies of PSCs have been achieved in the past few years, research on the stability of PSCs has been relatively less explored. In this study, a new kind of CdS hole-blocking layer replacing the traditional compact TiO2 layer is developed to improve the photostability of PSCs because the intrinsic oxygen vacancies of the TiO2 surface are suspected to be the main cause for the photoinduced degradation of PSCs. As a result, PSCs with the CdS layer exhibit considerably improved photostability, maintaining over 90% of the initial efficiency after continuous sunlight illumination for 12 h, while the TiO2 PSC retains only 18% of the initial efficiency under the same conditions. Charge-transfer characteristics related to photodegradation are investigated by various analyses including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and open-circuit voltage decay and time-resolved photoluminescence decay measurements. the CdS PSC exhibits negligible degradation in the charge-carrier dynamics, while the TiO2 PSC suffers from severely damaged characteristics like increased charge recombination rate, charge-transfer resistance, and reduced charge extraction rate.\", \"cis-2,3-Cyclopropanated abscisic acid (cis-CpABA) has high photostability and good ABA-like activity. To further investigate its activity and action mechanism, 2S, 3S-2,3-cyclopropanated ABA (3a) and 2R, 3R-2,3-cyclopropanated ABA (3b) were synthesized. Bioassay showed that 3a displayed higher inhibitory activity in germination than that of 3b and ABA at the concentration of 3.0 mu M, but 3a and 3b had much weaker inhibitory activity in inhibition seedling growth compared to ABA. The study of photostability revealed that 3a and 3b showed high stability under UV light exposure, which were 4 times and 3 times greater than (+/-)-ABA, respectively. Action mechanism study showed that 3a presented higher inhibition on phosphatase activity of HAB1 than 3b, although they all inferior to ABA. Molecular docking studies of 3a, 3b and ABA receptor PYL10 were agreement with the bioassay data and confirmed the importance of the configuration of the 2,3-cyclopropyl ABA analogs for their bioactivity in somewhat.

The expression of pan CK protein in HepG2 cells was observed by immunocytochemistry and direct immunofluorescence via QDs-Ab conjugates respectively. Fluorescence intensity and photostability of QDs were compared with those of FITC(fluorescein isothiocyanate). The results show that the QDs-Ab conjugates recognized specifically pan CK protein in HepG2 cells. Compared with FITC, CdTe QDs had higher brightness and photostability without obvious photobleaching under continuous exciting light illumination for 30 min and after the placement at room temperature for 3 d.

The drug powder was characterized by ultraviolet spectrophotomety, stereoscopy, scanning electron microscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, measurements of density, flowability, solubility and intrinsic dissolution rate (IDR), differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and photostability measurements. The results showed that nevirapine has high stability and is not susceptible to degradation under light exposure. The drug showed compatibility with the excipients tested (lactose, microctystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and polyvinyl acetate copolymer (PVP/PVA), and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC)). Nevirapine has low solubility, an acid medium being the most appropriate medium for assessing the release of the drug from dosage forms.

The photostability studies were carried out on inclusion complexes of rac-nicardipine with beta -cycloclextrin (beta -CD) and (2-hydroxypropyl)-beta -cyclodextrin (HP-beta -CD) in aqueous solutions (pH 7.4 and 5). The CE analysis of the solutions exposed to UV-A and UV-B radiations showed a photoprotective effect by beta -CD; conversely, HP-beta -CD proved to favor the drug photodegradation. Moreover, evidences for CDs-mediated stereoselective photodegradation of rac-nicardipine were obtained. In fact, two distinct photodegradation profiles were observed for the nicardipine enantiomers in the presence of the CDs. The photodegradation was found to follow an apparent first-order kinetics and two different kinetic constants (k) were obtained for the two enantiomers. After exposure to UV-A and UV-B radiations, the solutions contained residual nicardipine with a significant change in the enantiomeric ratio; this effect was depending on the CD used for the inclusion complexation.\", \"Using Ir(III) complexes as dopants in phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PhOLEDs) is the most successful strategy to attain long-lasting and highly-performant electroluminescent devices. Whilst highly efficient blue PhOLEDs are accessible, their limited operational lifetimes still restraint their practical use in lighting and displays. These short lifetimes are directly related to the low intrinsic photostability of blue Ir(III) complexes. This work uses first principles to unveil the mechanisms of degradation of blue phosphors arising from energetically hot excited states (congruent to 6.0 eV), and to propose a strategy for improving the stability of blue phosphors.\", \"Aromatic amino acids have large UV absorption cross-sections and low fluorescence quantum yields. Ultrafast internal conversion, which transforms electronic excitation energy to vibrational energy, was assumed to account for the photostability of amino acids. Recent theoretical and experimental investigations suggested that low fluorescence quantum yields of phenol (chromophore of tyrosine) are due to the dissociation from a repulsive excited state. Radicals generated from dissociation may undergo undesired reactions. It contradicts the observed photostability of amino acids. In this work, we explored the photodissociation dynamics of the tyrosine chromophores, 2-, 3- and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid in a molecular beam at 193 nm using multimass ion imaging techniques. We demonstrated that dissociation from the excited state is effectively quenched for the conformers of hydroxybenzoic acids with intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Ab initio calculations show that the excited state and the ground state potential energy surfaces change significantly for the conformers with intramolecular hydrogen bonding.

The typical A(L) phase-solubility profiles suggest the formation of the 1:1 inclusion complexes between Rh and the two CDs investigated, namely P-cyclodextrin and 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin and the resulting constant values of complex formation, K-c, were estimated. Due to the higher K, value, complex of Rhein with 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin was chosen for further investigation. Characterization in solution of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin/Rhein complex was achieved both by fluorescence and visible spectroscopic techniques. These results confirm the formation of inclusion complexes in solution and the 1:1 stoichiometry of the binary system. With respect to Rhein aqueous solution behavior, the inclusion complex appears to be able: (i) to enhance Rhein solubility: (ii) to control its neutral/anionic equilibrium: (iii) to affect both its electronic absorption and fluorescence spectra. Finally, the photostability of Rhein in the presence of cyclodextrins was evaluated. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The quantum yields of the photoreactions, Phi, were determined at various concentrations of the fluorene derivatives, oxygen concentration of the solvent, and irradiation wavelength. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of the photoproducts, corresponding to different excitation conditions, were analyzed. Photooxidation and electron transfer processes are proposed as photobleaching mechanisms for the fluorene derivatives in ACN. The relatively low photochemical quantum yields (Phi similar to 10(-4)) make the derivatives particularly promising for linear and nonlinear optical applications. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The gold nanoparticle is synthesized directly into the monomer solution of the polymer using laser ablation synthesis in liquid. The size of the particle is found from the transmission electron microscopy. Rhodamine-6G is then mixed with the nanoparticle-monomer solution and optical characterization of the solution is investigated. It is found that there is a pronounced quenching of fluorescence of rhodamine 6G due to fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The monomer solution containing rhodamine 6G and gold nanoparticles is now made into a cylindrical rod and drawn into a polymer optical fiber. Further, the photostability is calculated with respect to the pure dye doped polymer optical fiber.\", \"Uranine is a diagnostic aid in ophthalmology and used. as immuno-histological stain. Photostability study on such important compound using crossed-beam thermal lens (TL) technique was carried out. The study is based on the photodegradation (PD) behavior and rate regarding sonic parameters such as the incident laser power, wavelength, modulation frequency and sample concentration. The effects of such parameters on the TL signal and PD rate are discussed in details. ne rate of PD is found to be proportional to the power of the pumping laser and concentration of the sample within the investigated range. The modulation frequency is found not to influence the PD rate. The photochemical quantum yield has been measured using potassium ferrioxalate actinometry and it was found to be very low.\", \"Chemical physical analysis, photo-oxidative stability and lipid oxidation of innovative polymeric films based on blends of nylon 6 and ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol for use in food packaging have been investigated. Thermal mechanical analysis showed that the presence of an interfacial agent in the blend stabilized the films towards the action of permeants. Synergistic effects of the interfacial agent are reported with respect to UV photostability. Peroxide value (PY) was used to follow the oxidation of the olive oil, and for this parameter also the influence of the interfacial agent was clearly detected.

STFX sesquihydrate showed larger weight change between 1% and 95% relative humidities (RHs) than other crystalline forms. In the crystal of sesquihydrate, STFX molecules form a channel structure where water molecules exist. Contrary to sesquihydrate, water molecules in a monohydrate are located in well-defined and isolated crystallographic sites. The beta-form exhibited the worst photostability than any other forms under the irradiation of a D65 lamp. The intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the beta-form caused a red shift on the solid-state UV spectrum by prolonging the conjugation system of the quinolone ring, resulting in greater absorption of photoenergy and consequent degradation. Solubility is also affected by the crystalline structure. Standard free energy of the formation of STFX molecule in each crystalline form and/or lattice energy binding STFX molecules to retain the crystal structure might cause a difference in solubility.

Reaction pathways were identified and the respective yields and timescales determined. Excitation to the two lowest states, corresponding to the onset of the glycine absorption spectrum, was considered and the conformational dependence of the photochemical behavior was explored. The main processes on the femtosecond timescale are C-N dissociation producing the ammonia molecule, dissociation of hydrogen atom from the amino group and regeneration of the non-ionized glycine molecule via hydrogen transfer. It is found that the photochemical reaction yields strongly depend on the cluster conformation. A significant fraction of the electronic population is trapped in the n pi* minimum and the system deactivates only on longer timescales. Photostability of aminoacids can be rationalized in terms of the mechanisms described above. However, to actually reproduce glycine photostability, it is necessary to proceed beyond the cluster models. It is shown that the QM/MM approach within a simple electrostatic embedding scheme represents a reliable approach reproducing the main features of glycine photochemistry.\", \"Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a promising semiconductor that is suitable for bioimaging applications due to its intrinsic defect fluorescence. However, ZnO generally suffers from poor photostability. We report room-temperature single-photon emission from optical defects found in ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) formed by ion implantation followed by thermal oxidation in a silica substrate. We conduct a thorough investigation into the photophysics of a particularly bright defect and identify other single emitters within the NPs. Photostability was observed when the NPs were removed from the growth substrate and taken up by skin cells for in vitro imaging.\", \"Photobleaching and biotoxicity are the main bottlenecks for organic fluorescent dyes applied in real-time dynamic monitoring of living cells. Here, an unnatural amino acid, 4-nitro-3-phenyl-l-alanine (NPA), was used as a scaffold to covalently link a near-infrared fluorophore Cy5.5 and an amphiphilic polypeptide, poly[oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate]-block-poly[2-amino-N-4-(2-diisopropylamino-ethyl)-l-aspartic acid] (P(OEGMA)(21)-P(Asp)(16)-iPr), was then conjugated for increasing the photostability and improving the biocompatibility simultaneously. The protective agent of NPA can service as an effective triplet state quenching by intramolecular electron transfer between Cy5.5 and NPA. The less sensitivity of the electron-transfer process for molecular oxygen makes it an ideal photostabilized strategy for fluorophores applied in live-cell imaging. Bonding to copolymer is a common way for hydrophobic dyes to expand their application in biomedical imaging and increase their functionality, depending on the delivery system. The results indicate that Cy5.5-NPA-linked polypeptide copolymer exhibited an enhanced photostability and an excellent biocompatibility, which means this scaffolding strategy has a potential application in fluorescence-guided surgery, lived-cell imaging, and super-resolution microscopy.\", \"The degradation of CuInS2 (CIS) quantum dots (QDs) under excitation light due to photo-oxidization by O-2 has been a significant problem. Embedding QDs into a matrix to protect them against O-2 would improve their photostability. In this paper, hydrophilized CIS/ZnS/ZnS QDs prepared by a ligand exchange method were embedded in silica through a sol-gel method using tetramethylammonium silicate (TMAS) aqueous solution, in which negatively-charged nanoparticles can be well dispersed. QDs modified with 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) were well dispersed into TMAS-derived silica. The obtained monolithic TMAS-derived silica composites containing embedded MPA-modified CIS/ZnS/ZnS QDs exhibited high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (43-47%). Changes in PL intensity under continuous excitation were measured to evaluate the photostability of the QDs. The PL intensity of the composite was 105% that of the initial value after 5 h irradiation, while the PL intensities of as-prepared QDs and a PMMA composite decreased to 88% and 92%, respectively. The good gas barrier properties of TMAS-derived silica likely caused the high photostability by preventing O-2 from reaching the surface of the embedded QDs.\", \"beta-Carotene was used as a probe to investigate the protection offered by 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate, a photostabilizer, upon ultraviolet-A photodegradation. beta-Carotene and 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate were arranged in two distinct macroscopic configurations (core/shell and homogenous) in solution with tandem and single cuvettes. 2-Ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate was also combined with poly(methyl methacrylate) in solution to investigate the protective synergy between the photostabilizer and the polymer matrix. The choice of configuration played a more dominant role than the concentration of 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate in the degradation of beta-carotene. with beta-carotene remaining more stable in the homogeneous configuration. Changing configurations yielded different proximities of 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate to beta-carotene; closing the proximity increased the potential close interactions (<1 nm) where transfer of excited state energy from beta-carotene to 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate could occur resulting in increased photostability. The addition of poly( methyl methacrylate) had a negligible impact on the decay of beta-carotene in both configurations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It is shown that the photostability of the polymer materials on the basis of the obtained compositions is higher than of polymer materials activated by europium(III) compounds. Luminescent and photochemical characteristics of the obtained polymer compositions are determined by the molar ratio of the dopants: the maximum luminescence intensity and photostability is characteristic for the polymeric material containing europium(III) nitrate with 1,10-phenanthroline and anthranilic acid at a molar ratio of 1: 2.\", \"In the current paper, the strategy of tuning the optical and structural properties of Eu doped nanocrystals (NCs) is described with the emphasis on obtaining NCs with high brightness and photostability at the desired excitation and emission range. Those NCs are further chemically functionalized and covalently conjugated with lectins, providing specific (but reversible) targeting of pathological glycans on the surface of melanoma cells. Nanoconjugates are then injected intravenously into the blood stream of laboratory mice. Subsequently, histological slices were examined by fluorescence microscopy, whereas whole melanoma tumor were examined by ex vivo fluorescence imaging. Analysis revealed specific targeting, high intensity and photostability of the signal during visualization.\", \"Metallophthalocyanines form a very important class of commercial dyes and have achieved significant success in a variety of applications, in which their photostability is of fundamental importance. On this ground, considerable data on phthalocyanine photobleaching were published over recent years. We do not intend to give exhaustive compilation of the photobleaching quantum yields, which are known for wide circle of phthalocyanines in different solvents. This review begins by discussing pertinent background information about processes following phthalocyanine excitation.

High aggregation degree was observed for the dyes in the solid state. Association and twisted intramolecular charge transfer processes were found to affect the spectral properties of the compounds causing bathochromic shifts in absorption and fluorescence spectra. The extension of substituent pi conjugation gains molecular association evoked presumably by pi-pi interaction between the substituents of the adjacent molecules. Photostability of the complexes in different forms was analyzed and the distorted form stabilized by polymer matrix was found to be the most stable. The substituent nature did not affect strongly the photostability of dyes. Displacement of monomer-associate equilibrium in hybrid materials with polymethylmethacrylate and poly(9-vinylcarbazole) was exploited for tuning spectral characteristics of the materials. Two dyes readily forming aggregates at the lowest concentrations were applied for the fabrication of organic light-emitting diodes. The fabricated devices exhibited electroluminescence in the appropriate spectral ranges with moderate efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Aiming to improve the antioxidant effects of resveratrol and curcumin, lipid-core nanocapsules containing the combination of both polyphenols were developed. Physicochemical characteristics were evaluated and compared to the formulations containing each polyphenol individually. Co-encapsulation did not influence nanotechnological characteristics, and all formulations presented mean diameter around 200 nm, low polydispersity index, and encapsulation efficiency close to 100%. Nanoencapsulation increases the photostability of resveratrol and curcumin, and co-encapsulation improves resveratrol photostability. The in vitro antioxidant activity of polyphenols against HO. radicals was enhanced by nanoencapsulation, and a better effect was observed after their co-nanoencapsulation. Also, nanocapsules exhibited controlled release profile, for both polyphenols. The results showed that the strategy to co-encapsulate resveratrol and curcumin is a promising approach to improve the performance of medicines used to prevent and treat diseases associated with oxidative stress.

These molecules were synthesized by addition reactions using isothiocyanate derivates and amino- or hydroxyl-functionalized meso-tetra(aryl)porphyrins to give porphyrin analogs linked to glycosyl or benzyl moieties. Glycoporphyrin derivates could be obtained with better yields than their respective benzyl analogs. Thiourea and carbamate glycoporphyrins were also successfully synthesized through an ultrasound protocol with a remarkable decreasing of the reaction time. By NMR experiments we were able to evaluated the linker conformations which showed a preferred Z,Z conformation for the thiourea and carbamate derivatives. In addition, porphyrins were evaluated in terms of their UV-Vis spectra, singlet oxygen production, photostability and aggregation properties. Correlations between the linker type and the corresponding photophysical properties were observed. Carbamate porphyrins seem to be the most promising photosensitizers among the studied molecules due to their high singlet oxygen production, photostability and absence of self-assembling behavior in aqueous media.

Tretinoin and isotretinoin samples were extracted with acetonitrile by a procedure that can be completed in less than 10 min. Subsequent separation and quantification of amounts as low as 10 pmol was accomplished in less than 15 min using reversed-phase HPLC with isocratic elution with 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/acetonitrile (15:85, v/v). Validation experiments confirmed the precision and accuracy of the method. When applied to commercial tretinoin samples, recoveries of 104.9% for cream formulations and 107.7% for gel formulations were obtained. Application of the method for analysis of a tretinoin cream exposed to solar simulated light (SSL) demonstrated detection of the major photoisomerization product isotretinoin as well as 9-cis retinoic acid, demonstrating the utility of the method for studies of tretinoin photostability.

Two biocompatible systems consisting of core (CdSe) and core/shell (CdSe/ZnS) QDs surface modified with glutathione (GSH), named CdSe-GSH and CdSe/ZnS-GSH, respectively, were built. Upon photoirradiation using low laser power, both systems in HEPES buffer (pH 7.2) showed significant photoluminescence (PL) enhancements. CdSe/ZnS-GSH showed much less blue shifts in excitonic absorption and emission peaks without photobleaching compared with CdSe-GSH QDs system. X-ray diffraction showed that there is no change in the crystalline phase structure of the CdSe/ZnS-GSH QDs system after 1 h irradiation. Cell viability assessment, in the dark, demonstrated that no cytotoxic effects were shown upon incubation CdSe/ZnS-GSH QDs with normal human skin cell line for periods up to 72 h and at concentrations up to 100 nM. The present study demonstrates that CdSe/ZnS-GSH QDs system exhibits a high photostability with a relatively high PL efficiency in aqueous medium following low intensity photoexcitation, without dark cytotoxicity, making this system attractive for several important biomedical applications.\", \"The aims of this work were to improve cutaneous targeting and photostability of tretinoin by using nanosuspension formulation. Tretinoin is a drug widely used in the topical treatment of various dermatological diseases. The tretinoin nanosuspension was prepared by precipitation method and then characterized by photo correlation spectroscopy for mean size and size distribution, and by transmission electron microscopy for morphological studies. An oil in water tretinoin nanoemulsion was also prepared and used as a control. Dermal and transdermal delivery of both tretinoin nanosuspension and nanoemulsion were tested in vitro by using Franz diffusion cells and newborn pig skin. Photodegradation studies were carried out by UV irradiation (1 h, lambda = 366 nm) of the tretinoin nanosuspension in comparison with the nanoemulsion and a methanolic solution of the drug. During 8 h percutaneous experiments, the nanosuspesion was able to localize the drug into the pig skin with a very low transdermal drug delivery, whereas the nanoemulsion greatly improved drug permeation. UV irradiation of the nanosuspension showed a great improvement of tretinoin stability in comparison with both controls. Overall results show that nanosuspension might be a useful formulation for improving tretinoin dermal delivery and stability. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The state-of-the-art OSCs are typically fabricated from a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) active layer containing well-mixed donor and acceptor molecules in the nanometer regime. However, BHJ solar cells suffer from stability problems caused by the severe morphological changes upon thermal or illumination stress. In comparison, single-component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) based on a double-cable conjugated polymer with a covalently stabilized microstructure is suggested to be a key strategy for superior long-term stability. Here, the thermal- and photostability of SCOSCs based on a model double-cable polymer is systematically investigated. It is encouraging to find that under 90 degrees C & 1 sun illumination, the performance of SCOSCs remains substantially stable. Transport measurements show that charge generation and recombination (lifetime and recombination order) hardly change during the aging process. Particularly, the SCOSCs exhibit ultrahigh long-term thermal stability with 100% PCE remaining after heating at temperature up to 160 degrees C for over 400 h, indicating an excellent candidate for extremely rugged applications.\", \"Avobenzone is one of the most common UVA-filters in sunscreens, and is known to be photounstable. Some of the strategies used to stabilize this filter present some drawbacks like photosensitization reactions. Antioxidants are widely used as cosmetic ingredients that prevent photoageing and complement the photoprotection offered by the UV-filters preventing or reducing photogenerated reactive species. The purpose of this work was to study the effect of antioxidants in the photostabilization of avobenzone. The filter dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide or incorporated in a sunscreen formulation was irradiated with simulated solar radiation (750 W/m(2)). The tested antioxidants were vitamin C, vitamin E, and ubiquinone. The area under the curve of the absorption spectrum for UVA range and the sun protection factor (SPF) were calculated. Vitamin E (1:2), vitamin C (1:0.5) and ubiquinone (1:0.5) were the more effective concentrations increasing the photostability of avobenzone. In sunscreen formulations, the most effective photostabilizer was ubiquinone which also promoted an increase in SPF.\\nThis knowledge is important to improve effectiveness of sunscreen formulation. Antioxidants can be valuable ingredients for sunscreens with a triple activity of filter stabilization, SPF boosting and photoageing prevention. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this work in an attempt to investigate the potential beta-CD photostabilizing effect on TXM, the photodegradation rate of beta-CD complexed drug was monitored under simulated solar irradiation from Xenon arc lamp. The photodegradation was studied at pH 7.5. A new stability indicating Liquid Chromatography method, for TXM in the presence of beta-CD was used. According to the obtained results, in the case of free molecules increasing the concentration the photostability is enhanced. The effect of complexation with CDs on the photodegradation rate seems to vary depending on TXM initial concentration. At low TXM concentrations photodecomposition is retarded upon CD complexation, while at high concentrations the process is accelerated. Molecular dimerisation was studied by H-1(1D) NMR and 2D NOESY experiments. 2D ROESY spectra of complexed molecule were evaluated in order to confirm the complexation. TXM dimers could be considered as a critical parameter affecting oxicams photostability, in combination with the already described ESIPT phenomenon.\", \"Photobleaching is an effect terminating the photon output of fluorophores, limiting the duration of fluorescence-based experiments. Plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) can increase the overall fluorophore photostability through an enhancement of the radiative rate. In this work, we use the DNA origami technique to arrange a single fluorophore in the 12-nm gap of a silver NP dimer and study the number of emitted photons at the single molecule level. Our findings yielded a 30x enhancement in the average number of photons emitted before photobleaching. Numerical simulations are employed to rationalize our results.

However, increasing number of adverse effect case reports suggests that KP transdermal formulation can cause photoallergic reaction. The photoallergic potential of KP is attributable to the instability of KP under UV/visible light and subsequent formation of reactive degradation products. In this study, we investigated whether the inclusion of titanium dioxide (TiO2), a well-known mineral sunscreen agent, in the KP transdermal patch can prevent the photodegradation of KP and ultimately, can reduce photoallergic reaction. TiO2 inclusion in fabric backing effectively decreased the UV transmission through fabric patch throughout all UVA region from 320 to 380 nm and consistently, KP patch with TiO2 exhibited significantly increased photostability of KP. This enhanced photostability of KP resulted in reduced generation of photodegradation product as determined by HPLC-UV analysis. In a good accordance with these in vitro results, photosensitization test in guinea pig in vivo demonstrated low photoallergic reactions of KP patch with TiO2 compared to KP patch without TiO2, indeed. This study demonstrated that KP transdermal patch with TiO2-included backing can provide with improved photostability and photosafety over conventional fabric KP patch.\", \"The chemical stability of tretinoin (RA) and isotretinoin (13RA) in ethanol and dermatological cream preparations exposed to solar simulated light (SSL), UVA, and visible light has been studied. Photostability was monitored by an HPLC method that allowed simultaneous analysis of RA and 13RA, thus allowing photodegradation due to isomerization to other retinoids and photolysis to non-retinoid products to be monitored. Both retinoids undergo both isomerization and photolysis following SSL, UVA and visible light exposure but RA is more sensitive to photodegradation than 13RA. Degradation of both retinoids by photolysis is considerably greater in cream formulations than in ethanol and the photodegradation follows second order kinetics. Rate constants and half-lives for degradation of RA and 13RA in ethanol solution and cream preparations subjected to different light sources are reported. The UVA component of SSL is the major contributor to photodegradation. Since UVA penetrates deeply into skin, our results suggest that photodegradation of RA may contribute to the photosensitivity associated with RA therapy. Our studies suggest that development of improved formulations and the use of effective UVA sunscreens may reduce the side effects of RA therapy. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, an appreciable improvement was observed in oscillator strength. Using calculated results, we can conclude that silylation will results in better long-term photostability compared to its unsilylated counterpart due to their strong caging within the host matrix.

In this study, an organic ultraviolet (UV) shielding layer (coating) composed of a UV-curable paint, ethyl acetate, anhydrous alcohol, and an organic UV absorber is constructed on the surface of outdoor bamboo scrimber (OBS). The behaviour of OBS with or without this coating was investigated under accelerated weathering. The physical properties photostability of the samples before and during exposure were evaluated by characterizing the colour and glossiness. Contact angle (CA) measurements and surface free energy (SFE) calculations were performed to investigate the wettability of the coatings. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to characterize the changes in the functional groups of the coatings during weathering. The experimental results have shown that the colour, glossiness, CA, SFE, and functional groups photostability of the sample with the UV shielding coating increased significantly compared to those of the control sample. The coating with 5% organic UV absorber was considered as the best UV shielding layer in this study, as it successfully protected the OBS and reduced the surface photodegradation of the substrate and the coating itself.\", \"Composite systems where quantum dots (QDs) are combined with other nanomaterials (e.g., gold nanorods) in aqueous solutions have attracted broad attention. both for their potential in applications and for studies of fundamental processes.

As an excellent enhancer, the doped N-GQDs could improve the photoactivity and photostability of BiOBr nanoplates in the N-GQDs/BiOBr nanohybrids. Moreover, the photoactivity of N-GQDs/BiOBr nanohybrids was influenced remarkably by the content of the doped N-GQDs, and the results indicated that 3 wt% N-GQDs/BiOBr nanohybrids showed the optimal photoactivity. The N-GQDs/BiOBr nanohybrids showed excellent performance in the photoelectrochemical detection of glutathione as well as photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B. And a possible mechanism of N-GQDs on the enhancement photoactivity and photostability of N-GQDs/BiOBr nanohybrids was also proposed. This gave insights into N-GQDs/BiOBr nanohybrids and described a novel method to design and fabricate high photoactivity nanohybrids related to N-GQDs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Phase solubility profiles with both cyclodextrins employed were classified as A L type, indicating the formation of 1:1 stoichiometric complexes. Water-solubility, thermo- and photo-stability, and antioxidant activity of coenzyme Q(10) were significantly increased by complexation with cyclodextrins. Water-solubility of complexes was examined under various conditions (temperature and pH), stability studies in the solid state were performed under stress conditions (T = 80 degrees C, lambda = 254 nm), and coenzyme Q(10) concentration was determined by HPLC/MS and HPLC/UV, respectively. The DPPH radical-scavenging method was used for measuring antioxidant activity.\", \"Cyclodextrin complexes of the natural compound curcumin were prepared in order to improve the water solubility and the hydrolytic and photochemical stability of the compound. Complex formation resulted in an increase in water solubility at pH 5 by a factor of at least 10(4). The hydrolytic stability of curcumin under alkaline conditions was strongly improved by complex formation, while the photodecomposition rate was increased compared to a curcumin solution in organic solvents. The cavity size and the charge and bulkiness of,the cyclodextrin side-chains influenced the stability constant for complexation and the degradation rate of the curcumin molecule.

In comparison with shinorine, the ester molecule increases the photostability, the fluorescence quantum yield and the fluorescence lifetime in water as well as in the micellar solutions. The effects are more pronounced in sodium dodecyl sulfate solutions and suggest that the electrostatic attractions with the micellar interface contribute to limit the movement of the molecules and influence the relative rate of their deactivation channels. However, the predominance of the nonradiative decay is maintained together with the UV photoprotective ability of this atypical mycosporine species.\", \"Magnetic fluorescent silica nanotubes were fabricated using reverse micro-emulsions coupled with conventional sol-gel methods. Anodic aluminum oxide templates were used to separate spatially the magnetic and the fluorescent moieties on individual nanotubes and so prevent quenching of the fluorescence. C18 and fluorescent layers were deposited sequentially on silica. Magnetism was then obtained by the introduction of pre-made magnetic nanoparticles inside the nanotubes. The photo- and chemical stabilities of nanotubes were demonstrated through dye release and photobleaching tests. The produced nanotubes did not show fluorescence quenching upon the addition of the nanoparticles, an advantage over conventional spherical fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles. High photostability of nanotubes, magnetism and biocompatiblily make them potentially useful in bioanalysis.\", \"Chemical modification shows promise as a means of protecting wood from deterioration by fungi, but the systems tested to date have shown limited ability to photostabilise wood. In this study wood was esterified with benzoyl choride and the photostability of the modified wood was assessed. Benzoyl chloride was chosen because it was thought that the introduction of benzoyl groups into wood might act as a UV screen protecting wood from photo degradation. Benzoylation of wood to high weight gains (similar to 70%) was effective at protecting wood from photodegradation and there was an inverse relationship between weight gains due to benzoylation and mass losses of modified Scots pine wood veneers during weathering. FTIR spectroscopy and SEM of benzoylated wood exposed to natural weathering provided strong evidence for the stabilisation of lignin as a result of benzoylation. Benzoylation to high weight gain, however, caused extensive swelling of the wood cell wall and large losses in the tensile strength of veneers. The UV absorption characteristics of wood were modified by benzoylation and ESR spectroscopy of UV irradiated veneers clearly showed that benzoylation reduced the concentration of free radicals that are involved in the photodegradation of wood.

Their morphology, structure and photoluminescence properties were systematically characterized and studied. The results demonstrated that under the ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, the emission intensity for D-5(4) -> F-7(J) of Tb3+ in the composite fibers considerably increased, while it was greatly quenched in the pure complex, implying remarkably improved photostability in the composites. The composite fibers also demonstrated much better temperature stability of photoluminescence over the pure complex.\", \"Raw jute fabric was bleached with different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, a non-chlorine bleaching agent. One volume hydrogen peroxide bleaching of jute fabric was found to attain a satisfactory level of whiteness and photostability. An indepth analysis of the various physico-chemical properties of raw and hydrogen peroxide bleached jute fabric was carried out. Strength loss was found to be minimum after bleaching. In addition, alpha cellulose content of the fibre remained intact, alongwith a minimum loss of hemicellulose content. Use of hydrogen peroxide helped to minimise water pollution to a considerable degree. The process is environmentally friendly and is quite suitable for large scale operation, without any detrimental effect on environment, as normally encountered with chlorine-based bleaching of jute.\", \"The effect of hydrogenation of aromatic moieties on the photostability of lignin model compounds was studied by impregnating the compounds into Whatman filter paper sheets and subjecting these to accelerated yellowing experiments in a UV chamber: Hydrogenation of the aromatic rings of the model compounds 2-methoxy-4-propylphenol and 1,2-dimethoxy-4-propylbenzene gives a complete brightness stabilization (yellowing inhibition) within the model compounds. Results of the yellowing experiments also suggest that methoxy-aromatic (nonphenolic) structures in lignin are susceptible to photooxidation, under short-wavelength UV irradiation, even in the absence of an alpha-carbonyl group, alpha-aryl ethers and beta-O-4 aryl ethers.\", \"Background: Selective imaging of lysosomes by fluorescence microscopy using specific fluorescent probes allows the study of biological processes and it is potentially useful also for diagnosis. Lysosomes are involved in numerous physiological processes, such as bone and tissue remodeling, plasma membrane repair, and cholesterol homeostasis, along with cell death and cell signaling. Despite the great number of dyes available today on the market, the search for new fluorescent dyes easily up-taken by cells, biocompatible and bearing bright and long-lasting fluorescence is still a priority.\\nMethods: Two thiophene-based fluorescent dyes, TC1 and TC2, were synthetized as lysosome-specific probes.\\nResults: The new dyes showed high selectivity for fluorescent staining and imaging of lysosomes and disclosed high photostability, low toxicity and pH insensitivity in the range 2-10.\\nConclusions: The TC dyes exhibited high co-localization coefficients (>95%) and moderate quantum yields.

The behaviour of DBM clearly showed that its sensitivity to light is dependent on experimental conditions. DBM is stable in a polar solvent such as alcohol, whereas in a non-polar solvent, DBM is undergoing a reversible displacement of tautomeric equilibrium. This unexpected phenomenon is inhibited by a very small modification of polarity. The photodegradation products were detected using liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC/MS), to detect their molecular masses and thus obtain a broad idea of their identity. The incidence of photodegradation on the sun protection factor (SPF) value was measured. Because the degradation of DBM appears unpredictable, given that sunscreen products are marketed as supplementary health protectors against pathologies related to the harmful effects of sun exposure, the photostability of sun products should be a major safety criterion. There are two reasons for concern: firstly, reduction of protection as a function of progressive irradiation and secondly, the appearance of photodegradation products on the skin surface.

The extracts were previously submitted to photostability and antioxidant activity studies. Antioxidant activity was determined by chemiluminescence and the total phenolic content by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. Photostability of the extracts was also determined in the formulations after these have been developed. Experimental formulations were prepared containing extracts of Acai, Chamomile and Green Tea and submitted to accelerated stability studies, determination of rheological properties and to sensorial analysis. Results showed that all extracts had a potential antioxidant effect, Green Tea being the most promising one. It had the highest total phenolic content, which may explain the difference observed. The formulation containing Green Tea extract also showed the best performance in sensorial analysis. It is concluded that all extracts seem to have promising properties for use in cosmetic formulations. Green Tea extract, however, had a significant performance in all studies.

The effects of the type of cation and anion as well as the length of the cationic chain of the imidazolium ILs have been analyzed. These imidazolium-based ILs show high solar stability, slightly decreasing as the length of the cationic chain increases. The anion plays a main role in the stability of ILs under solar light, decreasing in the case of hydrophobic anions. The kind of head group (pyridinium or imidazolium) or the presence of functional groups (allyl, OH) also influence the solar light stability. DFT calculations on the fundamental and excited electronic states of the ILs were carried out to obtain a deeper insight on their photostability. In the case of the photocatalytic degradation of the ILs, complete conversion was achieved for all the ILS tested but mineralization reached 80% at the most. The rate of degradation increased with the length of the alkyl chain while the anion showed little effect. The pyridinium-based IL tested was the easiest to breakdown.\", \"Advances in fluorescence microscopy promise to unlock details of biological systems with high spatiotemporal precision. These new techniques also place a heavy demand on the 'photon budget'-the number of photons one can extract from a sample. Improving the photostability of small molecule fluorophores using chemistry is a straightforward method for increasing the photon budget. Here, we review the (sometimes sparse) efforts to understand the mechanism of fluorophore photobleaching and recent advances to improve photostability through reducing the propensity for oxidation or through intramolecular triplet-state quenching.

For this purpose, three hemicyanine dyes containing N-(2-carboxyethyl)-2,3,3-trimethyl-3H-indolium moiety were synthesized and their UV/Vis and fluorescence spectra, aggregation, photostability and association with bovine serum albumin were studied. The hemicyanine dyes with 2-ethylcarboxylic group was found to interact with bovine serum albumin, which is probably due to negative charge on the dye molecule at the expense of the carboxylic group and the ability to form hydrogen bonds with albumin.

Most of the state-of-the-art chromophores with high NLO response cannot be put to use because they are photochemically highly unstable. Good thermal and photochemical stabilities with preserved high hyperpolarizabilities can be achieved by replacement of an aromatic ring with easily delocalizable heteroaromatics, e. g., with benzothiazole. Furthermore, desirable modifications of the benzothiazole fragment lead to improvement in beta values. Here we report results of a comprehensive investigation of the photochemical stability of seven D-pi-A push-pull molecules based on a N-methylbenzothiazolium acceptor and a N,N-dimethylaminophenyl donor with a different length of conjugated bridge and different acceptor strength. The quantum yield (Phi) and the kinetic parameters of photoreactions were determined for existing photodegradation pathways on irradiation at 300-850 nm in MeOH. Trans-cis photoisomerization is proposed as a fast but inefficient photobleaching mechanism for these irradiation wavelengths. Self-sensitized photooxidation by O-1(2) makes very slow parallel photodegradation pathway and, albeit to small value of F, plays a dominant role in the photodegradation of the compounds investigated. Both structural modifications (extension of conjugated bridge and an additional acceptor group bonded to heterocycle) resulting in an increase of NLO response led to a decrease in photostability due to the self-sensitized O-1(2) photooxidative attack. Thus a compromise should be found between an increase in NLO response and a decrease in photostability to make a choice of studied compounds for practical applications.

Photodegradation of these dyes is mainly due to reaction with the in situ generated singlet oxygen (O-1(2)). With the aim to increase the lasing lifetimes of these dyes, we have designed and synthesized a new congener of the widely used BODIPY dye (PM567) by substitution at its B-centre. The new dye was highly fluorescent, and showed comparable lasing efficiency, but better photostability relative to PM567 in both polar (ethanol) and non-polar (1,4-dioxane) solvents, when excited by 2nd harmonic (532 nm) of a pulsed Nd-YAG laser. More interestingly, the lasing efficiency and photostability of both the dyes were much better in 1,4-dioxane than in ethanol. The relative photostabilities of the dyes were rationalized by absorption spectroscopic analyses of their triplet state properties in the respective solvents in the presence of a O-1(2) generator or quencher as an additive, pulse radiolysis studies and quantum chemical calculations.

The addition of effective antioxidants to sunscreens might afford suitable UV-VIS protection. Apigenin (API), chrysin (CRI) and beta-carotene (BTC) have shown potential for UV-VIS protection. This paper reports a photosafety and efficacy screening of such antioxidants through evaluation of the photostability, photoreactivity and phototoxicity as well as UVA/UVB ratio and critical wavelength. The assessment of the photostability, photoreactivity and phototoxicity of API, CRI and BTC, isolated and combined (CMB) was performed by HPLC, ROS assay and 3T3 NRU phototoxicity test, respectively. The phototoxicity test was also performed for CMB plus bemotrizinol (BMZ). The in vitro evaluation of the UVA protection was assessed by the determination of the UVA/UVB ratio and the critical wavelength. The antioxidants API, CRI, BTC and CMB were stable under UVA/VIS and VIS light. However weak photoreactivity after UVA/VIS irradiation was observed for API, CRI and CMB in the ROS assay. In the 3T3 NRU phototoxicity test, phototoxic potential was observed for CRI, BTC, CMB and CMB+BMZ after UVA/VIS exposure, and for BTC and CMB after VIS exposure. BMZ reduced the phototoxic potential of CMB in the VIS range. In the in vitro evaluation of UVA protection API, CRI, BTC, CMB and CMB+BMZ presented ultra UVA protection (UVA/UVB ratio > 0.9) and exhibited critical wavelength close to or above 370 nm. In conclusion, the use of API, CRI, BTC and their CMB aiming skin photoprotection could be considered safer in the VIS range. Furthermore, API presented the best performance in the photosafety screening among the studied antioxidants, since it was photostable and non-phototoxic in UVA/VIS and photostable, non-photoreactive and non-phototoxic in VIS range.

These studies as recommended by ICH Q1B are carried out using no less than 1.2 x 10(6) lux-hours in the visible region and no less than 200 W h/m(2) in UV light. However, normal drug product processing is carried out under fluorescent lamps that emit white light almost exclusively in the >400 nm region with a small UV quotient. We term these as ambient or mild light conditions. We tested several IgG1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs 1-5) under these ambient light conditions and compared them to the ICH light conditions. All the mAbs were significantly degraded under the ICH light but several mAbs (mAbs 3-5) were processed without impacting any product quality attributes under ambient or mild light conditions. Interestingly we observed site specific Trp oxidation in mAb1, while higher aggregation and color change were observed for mAb2 under mild light conditions. The recommended ICH light conditions have a high UV component and hence may not help to rank order photosensitivity under normal protein DP processing conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The dots were found to be of similar size (ca. 2 nm) but differ in their composition and surface chemistry. The photostability of the QDs was found to correlate with their ability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon light activation. CdSe QDs produce hydroxyl radicals immediately after irradiation due to their modest photostability, while CdSe(S) QDs start to generate the hydroxyl radicals only once they start to be bleached (ca. 30 min). Cytotoxicity experiments conducted on Escherichia coli cells revealed that CdSe QDs were the more toxic despite being the least loaded in cadmium. In addition, consistent with ROS assays, the cytotoxicity of the CdSe QDs appeared light-dependent and is in accordance with a light-dependent oxidative stress observed with an oxyR-based whole cell biosensor.

The 4-hydroxyphenyl compound proved to be photostable although the distances are within these limits, because the steric influence of the aromatic and carbonyl ester substituents in the adopted crystal packing prevents the movements that are necessary for the dimerization reaction.

Out-of-plane deformation of the six-membered ring, hydrogen abstraction from the amino and azine groups, as well as opening of the five-membered ring have been considered. All these photochemical reaction paths lead to low-lying S-0-S-1 conical intersections and thus provide channels for effective radiationless deactivation of the electronic excitation. The internal conversion processes associated with these channels open at different excitation energies. Taken together, they provide adenine with high level of intrinsic photostability over a broad range of UV irradiation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The new compounds were characterized by IR, H-1 NMR, electronic spectroscopy and mass spectra. The photochemical properties such as singlet oxygen generation and photostability were investigated in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solutions. The effects of the positions (peripheral or non-peripheral) of substituents on the phthalocyanine framework and variety (chlorine or acetate) of axial groups on the central indium(III) metal ion on these properties were also compared in this study.

PP films were exposed to medium pressure mercury lamp radiation in the laboratory for periods of up to 8 weeks and the degree of degradation (oxidation/ deterioration) was examined using FTIR spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as well as by measuring changes in the mechanical properties, contact angle, and density. The results of these measurements indicate that unstabilized PP films degraded after only 240-h irradiation. By adding an organic pigment to PP films along with antioxidant and HALS, the photostability of PP films increased to the 1500-h level.

This feature significantly changes the photophysical and optical properties of these carotenoids, and has an impact on solar energy conversion and light induced oxidative damage. In this study we have applied EPR and optical absorption spectroscopy to investigate how complexation can affect the aggregation ability of the xanthophyll carotenoids zeaxanthin, lutein, and astaxanthin, their photostability, and antioxidant activity. It was shown that complexation with the poly-saccharide arabinogalactan (AG) polymer matrix and the triterpene glycoside glycyrrhizin (GA) dimer reduced the aggregation rate but did not inhibit aggregation completely. Moreover, these complexants form inclusion complexes with both monomer and H-aggregates for carotenoids. H-aggregates of carotenoids exhibit higher photostability in aqueous solutions as compared with monomers, but much lower antioxidant activity. It was found that complexation increases the photostability of both monomers and the aggregates of xanthophyll carotenoids. Also their ability to trap hydroperoxyl radicals increases in the presence of GA as the GA forms a donutlike dimer in which the hydrophobic polyene chain of the xanthophylls and their H-aggregates lies protected within the donut hole, permitting the hydrophilic ends to be exposed to the surroundings.\", \"The effect of counterion was evaluated on the photodegradation behavior of six prazosin salts, viz., prazosin hydrochloride anhydrous, prazosin hydrochloride polyhydrate, prazosin tosylate anhydrous, prazosin tosylate monohydrate, prazosin oxalate dihydrate, and prazosin camsylate anhydrous. The salts were subjected to UV-Visible irradiation in a photostability test chamber for 10 days. The samples were analyzed for chemical changes by a specific stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography method. pH of the microenvironment was determined in 10% w/v aqueous slurry of the salts. The observed order of photostability was: prazosin hydrochloride anhydrous>prazosin camsylate anhydrous similar to prazosin-free base>prazosin hydrochloride polyhydrate>prazosin tosylate anhydrous>prazosin oxalate dihydrate similar to prazosin tosylate monohydrate. Multivariate analysis of the photodegradation behavior suggested predominant contribution of the state of hydration and also intrinsic photosensitivity of the counterion. Overall, hydrated salts showed higher photodegradation compared to their anhydrous counterparts. Within the anhydrous salts, aromatic and carbonyl counterion-containing salts showed higher susceptibility to light. The pH of microenvironment furthermore contributed to photodegradation of prazosin salts, especially for drug counterions with inherent higher pH. The study reveals importance of selection of a suitable drug salt form for photosensitive drugs during preformulation stage of drug development.\", \"Solid lipid microparticles (SLMs) loaded with the sunscreen agent, octyl-dimethyl amino benzoate (ODAB), were prepared in order to achieve enhanced sunscreen photostability. The microparticles were produced by the melt dispersion technique using glyceryl behenate as lipidic material and poloxamer 188 as the emulsifier. The obtained SLMs showed proper features in terms of morphology, size distribution (1.67-15.81 mu m) and ODAB loading (16.15 +/- 0.11%, w/w). The sunscreen release from the SLMs was slower than its dissolution rate and the photodecomposition of ODAB was markedly decreased (> 51.3%) by encapsulation into the lipid microparticles. The efficacy of the SLM carrier system was also evaluated after their introduction in model topical formulations (i.e., hydrogel and oil-in-water emulsion). Further in vitro release measurements, performed using Franz diffusion cells with polycarbonate membranes, indicated that the retention capacity of the microparticles was lost after their incorporation into the emulsion, whereas it was retained in the hydrogel. Moreover, the SLMs achieved a reduction of the sunscreen photodegradation in the hydrogel vehicle (the ODAB loss decreased from 87.4% to 59.1%), whereas no significant photoprotective effect was observed in the emulsion. Therefore, the efficacy of the ODAB-loaded SLMs was markedly affected by the vehicle. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

When the QDs were coated by silica, well-defined spherical shapes were formed and the photoluminescence (PL) efficiency was decreased from 4.9% to 1.9% with increasing water content W (W = [H2O]/[AOT]). In addition, ZnSe QDs showed the good photostability. The present method does not require a hot reaction temperature or extremely toxic H2Se gas as a Se precursor. Moreover, they are cadmium free and less toxic. Therefore, the present method can be a safer and more economical method for obtaining the silica-encapsulated ZnSe QDs, which may be a potential material for Light-Emitting Diode (LED), solar cell, and biosensors.\", \"Crystal facets engineering of semiconductor catalysts with different exposed facets has been proven as a versatile approach to enhance their photocatalytic performance. Herein, for the first time, a facet junction engineered hexagonal CdS single crystal with exposing {0001} and {10 (1) over bar0} facets was synthesized by hydrothermal reaction via adjusting the molar ratio of S2-/Cd2+ precursor. The co-exposed {0001} and {10 (1) over bar0} facets on hexagonal CdS single crystals with continuous band bending and well-defined epitaxial interfaces showed highly efficient visible-light-induced H-2 evolution. The maximum photocatalytic H-2 production rate of 24.33 mmol h(-1) g(-1) is obtained over the facet-junction engineered hexagonal CdS-5 single crystals with an apparent quantum efficiency of 11.18% at 470 nm, which is about 5.27 times greater than CdS-1 nanoparticles. Also, superior photostability is also achieved, even after 25 consecutive cycles during 100 h light irradiation keeping impregnated in strong alkaline sacrificial agent beyond 20 days, the initial photoactivity is still remained. The enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution activity and photostability can be ascribed to the type-II band alignment between the co-exposed {0001} and {10 (1) over bar0} facets that significantly promoted the separation rate of photo-generated electrons and holes. And the small amount of sulfur vacancies are also benefit for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of CdS-5. The time-resolved fluorescence (TRPL) decay and photoelectrochemical test further proved the effective spatial charge separation. This work provides a feasible and simple strategy for designing of facet-junction engineered CdS single crystals with highly efficient photocatalytic activity and unprecedented photostability.\", \"In this review, we make an attempt to compare the characteristics and applications of red and near infrared cyanine and squaraine dyes used for biological research, biomedical assays, and high-throughput screening. While the favorable photophysical properties of cyanine dyes makes them predestined as covalent labels, the environmentally sensitive squaraine dyes are utilizable as both florescent probes and labels. Reducing the aggregation tendencies of these dyes in aqueous media seems to be one of the most promising ways to improve their brightness, fluorescence lifetimes, and photostability. Indolenine-based squaraines including ring-substituted squaraines exhibit great potential for the design of bright and sensitive fluorescent probes and labels with increased photostability.\", \"Aim of this work was the study of ferulic acid/cyclodextrin (CD) association complexes. Ferulic acid (FA) is a compound well-known as antioxidant and photoprotective agent (approved in Japan as sunscreen). Notwithstanding this, it is poorly suited for cosmetic applications because it undergoes functional and organoleptic modifications, when it is exposed to air, UV-light and heat. For this reason we prepared a set of FA/CD complexes with the aim to improve its physico-chemical stability. The inclusion complexes were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR). The FA/alpha-CD complex showed the most promising properties (high association constant, high degree of photostability, slower FA release) as sunscreen delivery system.\", \"The photoefficiency of CdS/TiO2 electrodes can be enhanced by employing efficient method of CdS sensitization from which, the contact area, thickness of CdS layer, and the recombination of photoelectrons with electrolyte can be controlled. Here, we demonstrate a simple solvothermal approach of CdS quantum dots (QDs) sensitization on TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) film coated on FTO. Our new approach prevents the clogging of CdS QDs and promotes uniform deposition of QDs throughout the mesoporous TiO2 NP film. The sensitization of CdS can be controlled by the reaction time and the concentration of the precursors. The solvothermally sensitized photoanodes exhibit enhanced photocurrents and fill factors and improved photostability in aqueous solution compared to the one prepared by a conventional SILAR method. Open-circuit potential decay measurement under shutting off illumination shows that the lifetime of photoelectron is extended with solvothermally prepared CdS layer, indicating efficient suppression of recombination of the accumulated electron in TiO2 to the electrolyte. This methodology can be applied in making more efficient heterojunctions consisting of CdS and other wide band gap oxide semiconductors which could improve charge separation and mitigate charge recombination for photoelectrochemical applications.

These products were isolated and characterised by spectroscopic techniques, i.e. infrared, ultraviolet, and fluorescent spectra, and confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The photostability of the new compounds and two optical brighteners containing an unsaturated group without a stabiliser fragment was studied. It was found that the compounds containing tetramethylpiperidine have better photostability. The possibility of the copolymerisation of the unsaturated compounds with acrylonitrile was investigated, and self-whitening polymers with an intense blue fluorescence were obtained. It was established that 85-86% of the fluorophores are chemically bound to the polymer chain.\", \"Broad band solid state dye lasers based on LDS 698 doped in modified polymethyl methacrylate (MPMMA) with laser wavelength about 650nm were demonstrated. It was demonstrated that the fluorescence spectra of LDS 698 in solid host MPMMA displays an obvious blue shift about 50nm comparing with that in ethanol solution. The dye concentration has great effect on the laser's performance including laser slope efficiency and lifetime. The lifetime increased dramatically with the increase of the LDS698 concentration. With pump repetition rate of 10Hz and intensity of 0.1J/cm(2), the maximum lifetime 300,000 shots corresponding normalized photostability 102GJ/mol was obtained with LDS 698 at 1.5 x 10(-4) mol/L.

The photocatalytic hydrogen-production activities of these samples were evaluated using Na2S and Na2SO3 as sacrificial reagents in water under visible-light illumination (lambda >= 420 nm). The results show that after a spontaneous adsorption process g-C3N4 is successfully coated on CdS nanowires with intimate contact and can significantly improve the photocatalytic hydrogen-production rate of CdS nanowires, which reaches an optimal value of up to 4152 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) at the g-C3N4 content of 2 wt %. More importantly, g-C3N4 coating can substantially reinforce the photostability of CdS nanowires even in a nonsacrificial system. The synergic effect between g-C3N4 and CdS, which can effectively accelerate the charge separation and transfer corrosive holes from CdS to robust C3N4, was proposed to be responsible for the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity and photostability. The possible conditions necessary for the synergic effect to work in a CdS/g-C3N4 core/shell configuration is also discussed.\", \"It is desirable and challenging to prevent E-resveratrol (E-RSV) from photoisomerizing to its Z-configuration to preserve its biological and pharmacological activities. The aim of this research was to evaluate the photostability of E-RSV-loaded supramolecular structures and the skin penetration profile of chemically and physically stable nanoestructured formulations. Different supramolecular structures were developed to act as carriers for E-RSV, that is, liposomes, polymeric lipid-core nanocapsules and nanospheres and solid lipid nanoparticles. The degrees of photostability of these formulations were compared with that of an ethanolic solution of E-RSV. The skin penetration profiles of the stable formulations were obtained using vertical diffusion cells (protected from light and under UVA radiation) with porcine skin as the membrane, followed by tape stripping and separation of the viable epidermis and dermis in a heated water bath. Photoisomerization was significantly delayed by the association of resveratrol with the nanocarriers independently of the supramolecular structure. Liposomes were the particles capable of maintaining E-RSV concentration for the longest time. On the other hand, E-RSV-loaded liposomes reduced in size showing low physical stability under UVA radiation. In the dark, the skin penetration profiles were very similar, but under UVA radiation the E-RSV-loaded nanocarriers showed increasing amounts in the total epidermis.\", \"Water-soluble tetraazaperopyrene (TAPP) derivatives have been synthesized, which show both high photostability and high fluorescence quantum yields (480%) in water.

The dye-embedded Nafion Na+ membranes are found to have excellent photostability and lasing properties as those of sol-gel materials.\", \"Remarkable increases in the performance of complex systems can be achieved by a collective approach to optimizing individual factors that influence performance. This approach, termed the aggregation of marginal gains, is tested here as a means of improving the performance of exterior clear-coatings. We focused on five factors that influence clear-coating performance: dimensional stability of wood; photostability of the wood surface; moisture ingress via end-grain; coating flexibility and photostability; and finally coating thickness. We performed preliminary research to select effective wood pre-treatments and durable clear-coatings, and then tested coating systems with good solutions to each of the aforementioned issues (factors). Red oak and radiata pine panels were modified with PF-resin, end-sealed, and thick acrylic, alkyd or spar varnishes were applied to the panels. Panels were exposed to the weather and the level of coating defects was assessed every year over a 4-year period. All of the coatings are performing well on PF-modified pine after 4 years' outdoor exposure. In contrast, coatings failed after 2 years on unmodified pine and they are failing on PF-modified oak. We conclude that our approach shows promise. Future research will build on the current work by developing solutions to additional factors that influence clear-coating performance.\", \"The influence of the polymeric amorphous materials on the physicochemical and drug release properties of drug-loaded nanocapsules as well as their role on the protection of the entrapped drug against the degradation induced by UV radiation was evaluated. Nanocapsules were prepared by interfacial deposition of preformed polymer (PLA, PLGA 50:50, and PLGA 85:15) using clobetasol propionate as the drug model. In vitro drug release was evaluated by the dialysis bag method. Photochemical stability was studied under UVA radiation. After preparation, all formulations presented nanometric mean size (180-200 nm), polydispersity index below 0.20, acid pH, negative zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency close to 100%. Clobetasol propionate-loaded PLGA nanocapsules presented a lower physicochemical stability, showing a high drug leakage during 3 months of storage. In vitro studies showed biphasic drug release from all nanocapsules (according to an anomalous transport) and no influence of the hydrophilic characteristics of the amorphous polymeric material on the release rate. The photostability of clobetasol propionate under UVA radiation was improved by its incorporation into PLA and PLGA nanocapsules showing that besides semicrystalline polymers, amorphous polymers could also efficiently protect nanoencapsulated drugs against UV radiation.\", \"Due to mitochondria involved in both apoptotic and necrotic cell death, labeling and imaging mitochondria has attracted considerable interest. However, conventional organic dyes used for mitochondrial imaging are limited because of their poor photostability. Considering that gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) possess some advantages over considerable interest, such as excellent photostability and strong fluorescence emission, we herein prepared a mitochondria-targeted fluorescent probe, AuNCs@CS-TPP, based on a covalent link between triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cations and chitosan-coated AuNCs (AuNCs@CS). The as-prepared AuNCs@CS-TPP exhibited a bluish fluorescence emission at 440 nm with a quantum yield of 8.5%. Meanwhile, the fluorescence intensity of AuNCs@CS-TPP labeled HeLa cells did not show apparent decrease after 8 min irradiation. Cytotoxicity assay showed that AuNCs@CS-TPP did not display any appreciable cytotoxicity on cells even at a concentration of 60 mu g mL(-1). In addition, the result of fluorescence co-localization imaging in vitro indicated that AuNCs@CS-TPP could selectively accumulate into mitochondria of HeLa cells and HepG2 cells. These findings demonstrated that AuNCs@CS-TPP possessed superior photostability, low cytotoxicity, high sensitivity and target-specificity to mitochondria, allowing labeling and imaging of the mitochondria in living cells.

Stability was evaluated by monitoring visible light absorbance spectral changes, in real time, during 455 nm photolysis (30 nm fwhm, 475 mW/cm(2)) in a variety of conditions relevant to dye-sensitized solar cells and dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cells. Desorption (k(des)) and photochemical (k(chem)) processes were observed and found to be dependent upon solvent, anion, semiconductor, and presence of oxygen. Both processes are affected by oxygen with k(des) and k(photo) noticeably smaller in argon saturated solution. Desorption was strongly solvent and pH dependent with desorption rates increasing in the order: methanol (MeOH) approximate to acetonitrile (MeCN) < propylene carbonate (PC) < pH 1 << pH 7. Photochemistry occurred in MeOH and PC but not in aqueous, 0.1 M HClO4 and MeCN. The anion and solvent dependence of k(photo) strongly suggests the photoreaction involves ligand substitution initiated by population of metal centered d-d states. The relative stability of -PO3H2- versus -COOH-substituted [Ru-II(bpy)(3)](2+) was also quantitatively established.\", \"A large anionic pigment has been intercalated into a layered double hydroxide (LDH) host by ion-exchange of an Mg/Al LDH-nitrate precursor with a solution of C.I. Pigment Red 48:2 (the calcium salt of 4-((5-chloro-4-methyl-2-sulfophenyl)azo)-3-hydroxy-2-naphthalene-carboxylic acid), in ethane- 1,2-diol. After intercalation of the pigment, the interlayer distance in the LDH increases from 0.86 to 1.72 nm. Infrared spectra and TG-DTA curves reveal the presence of a complex system of supramolecular host-guest interactions. The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of C.I. Pigment Red 48:2 show marked changes after heating at 200 degreesC and above, whereas there are no significant changes in the spectra of the intercalated pigment after heating at temperatures up to 300 degreesC, showing that the thermostability is markedly enhanced by intercalation in the LDH host. The pigment-intercalated LDHs exhibits much higher photostability to UV light than the pristine pigment, in the case of both the pure solids and their composites with polypropylene, as shown by measurement of CIE 1976 L*a*h* color difference (DeltaE) values.

QD525 was used to detect HER2 using home-made HER2-specific monoclonal antibodies in fixed and living HER2(+) SKBR-3 cell line and breast cancer tissues. Additionally, we compared fluorescence intensity (FI), photostability and staining index (SI) of QD525 signals at different exposure times and two excitation wavelengths with those of the conventional organic dye, FITC. Labeling signals of QD525 in both fixed and living breast cancer cells and tissue preparations were found to be significantly higher than those of FITC at 460-495 nm excitation wavelengths. Interestingly, when excited at 330-385 nm, the superiority of QD525 was more highlighted with at least 4-5 fold higher FI and SI compared to FITC. Moreover, QDs exhibited exceptional photostability during continuous illumination of cancerous cells and tissues, while FITC signal faded very quickly. QDs can be used as sensitive reporters for in situ detection of tumor markers which in turn could be viewed as a novel approach for early detection of cancers. To take comprehensive advantage of QDs, it is necessary that their optimal excitation wavelength is employed.\", \"Luminescent hybrid materials were prepared by covalently functionalizing nanodiamonds (NDs) with rare earth (RE) complexes.

The emission colors of the hybrid composite of ND-PMA-EuxTby can be tuned from red to orange, yellow and green by adjusting the molar ratio of Eu3+ to Tb3+. Moreover, the luminescence of the hybrid composites exhibits remarkable photostability under ultraviolet irradiation for 60 h. As a proof-of-concept experiment, the as-synthesized ND-PMA-Eu and ND-PMA-Tb were employed as the phosphors for red and green light-emitting-diode (LED) devices with ultraviolet (UV) chips.

The photodegradation performance of both g-C3N4/BiOCl and g-C3N4/BiOBr composites was superior to that of pure g-C3N4 or the corresponding bismuth oxyhalides, possibly because of efficient separation of photogenerated carriers at the interface between g-C3N4 and BiOX (X = Cl, Br).

Asian bamboos, well known and widely cultivated, are already used in cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries thanks to their rich phenolic contents which is related to their antioxidant activity. This study aimed to evaluate the photoprotective and antioxidant activities of five native Brazilian bamboo species. Firstly, hydroalcoholic extracts from culms and leaves of Aulonemia aristulata (Doll) McClure., Chusquea bambusoides Rupr. ex Doll, Chusquea capituliflora Trin. var. pubescens McClure, Chusquea meyeriana Rupr., Merostachys pluriflora Munro ex E.G. Camus were evaluated for their DPPH scavenging activity and total contents of flavonoids and phenolic compounds. Secondly, cosmetic formulations containing the extracts in a combination with three different synthetic ultraviolet (UV) filters (avobenzone, octyldimethyl PABA, and octyl methoxycinnamate) were developed to evaluate their Sun Protection Factor (SPF), critical wavelength (c lambda) and photostability by diffuse transmittance analysis to determine the interactions involving the extracts and the anti-UV active ingredients. The bamboos' antioxidant potential, expressed in IC50, varied between 137.55 and 260 mu g/mL. Phenolic contents ranged from 43.64 to 87.81 mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per g of plant material. The extract richest in flavonoids was that from C. bambusoides leaves with 6.44 mg of equivalents of quercetin (EQ) per g of dried leaves. The SPF of the formulations with bamboo extracts varied between 34 and 86 before the irradiation, and the obtained UV absorption profile allowed to classify them as broad spectrum. After irradiation, the SPF values diminished to 14-44, whereas, the area of the absorbed wavelengths remained equal. This study showed that the addition of bamboo extracts to commercial UV filters increased significantly their SPF and photostability.\", \"We demonstrate a strategy to transfer the zinc(II) sensitivity of a fluoroionophore with low photostability and a broad emission band to a bright and photostable fluorophore with a narrow emission band. The two fluorophores are covalently connected to afford an intramolecular Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) conjugate. The FRET donor in the conjugate is a zinc(II)-sensitive arylvinylbipyridyl fluoroionophore, the absorption and emission of which undergo bathochromic shifts upon zinc(II) coordination. When the FRET donor is excited, efficient intramolecular energy transfer occurs to result in the emission of the acceptor boron di-pyrromethene (4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a, 4a-diaza-s-indacene or BODIPY) as a function of zinc(II) concentration. The broad emission band of the donor/zinc(II)complex is transformed into the strong, narrow emission band of the BODIPY acceptor in the FRET conjugates, which can be captured within the narrow emission window that is preferred for multicolor imaging experiments. In addition to competing with other nonradiative decay processes of the FRET donor, the rapid intramolecular FRET of the excited FRET-conjugate molecule protects the donor fluorophore from photobleaching, thus enhancing the photostability of the indicator. FRET conjugates 3 and 4 contain aliphatic amino groups, which selectively target lysosomes in mammalian cells. This subcellular localization preference was verified by using confocal fluorescence microscopy, which also shows the zinc(II)-enhanced emission of 3 and 4 in lysosomes. It was further shown using two-color structured illumination microscopy (SIM), which is capable of extending the lateral resolution over the Abbe diffraction limit by a factor of two, that the morpholino-functionalized compound 4 localizes in the interior of lysosomes, rather than anchoring on the lysosomal membranes, of live HeLa cells.\", \"The increasing interest around imaging and microsurgery techniques based on the photoacoustic effect has boosted active research into the development of exogenous contrast agents that may enhance the potential of this innovative approach.\\nIn this context, plasmonic particles as gold nanorods are achieving resounding interest, owing to their efficiency of photothermal conversion, intense optical absorbance in the near infrared region, inertness in the body and convenience for conjugation with ligands of molecular targets.\\nOn the other hand, the photoinstability of plasmonic particles remains a remarkable obstacle. In particular, gold nanorods easily reshape into nanospheres and so lose their optical absorbance in the near infrared region, under exposure to few-ns-long laser pulses. This issue is attracting much attention and stimulating ad-hoc solutions, such as the addition of rigid shells and the optimization of multiple parameters.\\nIn this contribution, we focus on the influence of the shape of gold nanorods on their photothermal behavior and photostability. We describe the photothermal process in the gold nanorods by modeling their optical absorption and consequent temperature dynamics as a function of their aspect ratio (length / diameter).\\nOur results suggest that increasing the aspect ratio does probably not limit the photostability of gold nanorods, while shifting the plasmonic peak towards wavelengths around 1100 nm, which hold more technological interest.\", \"Glutathione (GSH) plays a critical role in maintaining oxidation-reduction homeostasis in biological systems. Considering the detection of GSH by fluorescence sensors is limited by either the short wavelength emission or the poor photostability, a highly stable colorimetric and ratiometric NIR fluorescent sensor (DCM-S) for GSH detection has been constructed on the basis of dicyanomethylene-4H-pyran (DCM) chromophore. The specific disulfide bond is incorporated via a carbamate linker as the GSH responsive group, which simultaneously blue-shifts and quenches the fluorescence. Upon addition of GSH, DCM-S exhibits outstanding colorimetric (from yellow to red) and ratiometric fluorescent response with the 6-fold enhancement of NIR fluorescence at 665 nm in quantum yield. More importantly, the GSH-treated DCM-S (DCM-NH2 actually) possesses 20-fold longer fluorescence half-life period as well as much better photostability than the FDA-approved ICG. Finally, the ratiometric detection of GSH is also successfully operated in the living cell imaging, exhibiting NIR fluorescence and large Stokes shift (215 nm) with nearly no background fluorescence interference. As a consequence, DCM-S can be utilized as colorimetric and ratiometric NIR fluorescent sensor for GSH, with a great potential in the development of GSH-induced drug delivery system.\", \"We develop a controllable approach to prepare ordered-CdTe quantum dots (QDs) polyamidoamine (PAMAM) nanocomposites (NCPs) by self-assembly growth of simple CdTe-PAMAM in aqueous solution.

In this work, we present the synthesis and the photophysical and structural characterization of perfluorinated phenyl bifuran (PFB-2F), which displays high photostability, while maintaining strong fluorescence quantum efficiency in both solution and the solid state. X-Ray crystallography reveals that, unlike its thiophene analog, PFB-2F has a completely planar backbone, with slip-stacked packing and short interplanar distances. PFB-2F crystals display mechanofluorochromic behavior, which renders perfluorophenyl-substituted oligofurans potential candidates for both stable optoelectronic devices and responsive optical materials.\", \"Two new UV filters for use in cosmetic sunscreens have been developed. Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (BEMT) is a hydroxy-phenyl-triazine derivative, which has been designed for optimal spectral performance, excellent photostability, and solubility in cosmetic oils. Methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol (MBBT) is the active ingredient of a particulate UV-filter system, which is available as a 50% dispersion of MBBT Since the UV-attenuating efficacy depends strongly on particle size, the material is micronised to particle sizes below 200 nm. The mode of action of this photostable filter system is governed to about 90% by absorption and 10% by scattering of UV light. Both filters show broad-spectrum characteristics with significant protection in the UVA range.\", \"For a typical perovskite solar cell (PKSC), the electron transport layer (ETL) has a great effect on device performance and stability. Herein, we manifest that low-temperature solution-processed ZnSe can be used as a potential ETL for PKSCs. Our optimized device with ZnSe ETL has achieved a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.78% with negligible hysteresis, compared with the TiO2 based cell (13.76%). This enhanced photovoltaic performance is attributed to the suitable band alignment, high electron mobility, and reduced charge accumulation at the interface of ETL/perovskite. Encouraging results were obtained when the thin layer of ZnSe cooperated with TiO2. It shows that the device based on the TiO2/ZnSe ETL with cascade conduction band level can effectively reduce the interfacial charge recombination and promote carrier transfer with the champion PCE of 18.57%. In addition, the ZnSe-based device exhibits a better photostability than the control device due to the greater ultraviolet (UV) light harvesting of the ZnSe layer, which can efficiently prevent the perovskite film from intense UV-light exposure to avoid associated degradation. Consequently, our results present that a promising ETL can be a potential candidate of the n-type ETL for commercialization of efficient and photostable PKSCs.\", \"Luminescent carbon nanodots (CDots) have attracted much attention, but their luminescence is usually quenched in solid state. Efficient green or yellow emissive CDot-based phosphors are scarce. In this work, green emissive CDot@NaCl composite phosphors were fabricated through a convenient, low cost and eco-friendly way by embedding green emissive CDots (g-CDot) in NaCl crystals. With the protection of NaCl host, the g-CDot@NaCl composite phosphors exhibit good photostability, significant resistance to organic solvents, and improved photoluminescence quantum yields up to 25%. White light-emitting diodes with tunable color temperatures (3944-5478 K) and CIE coordinates have been realized based on the g-CDot@NaCl composite phosphors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We have established that fluorine atoms in the biphenyl moiety of the benzoxasole derivatives significantly improve the stability of the TVD films relative to oxidative aging compared with hexyloxy substituents. Irradiation with UV light stimulates quenching of luminescence and structuring of the TVD film of the difluoro-substituted derivative.\", \"Zirconia gel films were prepared by a dipping method from a 2-propanol solution of zirconium tetra-n-butoxide (ZTNB) stabilized with diethanolamine (DEA) and acetoin. In the case of the ZTNB-DEA system, crystallization to zirconia occurred at 480 degreesC, while in the case of the ZTNB-acetoin system it occured at 380 degreesC. The density of gel film prepared from the ZTNB-DEA system was higher than that from the ZTNB-acetoin system. Neutral acetoin could act as a good stabilizer for dye-doped ZTNB gel films. The photostability of dyes depended on the combination between dyes and stabilizers. DEA could act as an anti-oxidizing reagent and an electron donor to depress and accelerate the photo-decomposition of the dyes, respectively.\", \"Natural dyes extracted from fruit (FBV) and root (RBV) of barberry (Berberis vulgaris) and fruit (FPA) and stalk (SPA) of pokeweed (Phytolacca americana) were used as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). All the extracts were employed without any modifications, such as purifications or addition of stabilizers. Anthocyanin and isoquinoline alkaloid were identified as the main components for FBV and RBV extracts, respectively, whereas betalain for FPA and SPA extracts. SPA and FPA displayed much broader absorption spectra than the others, which is beneficial to light harvesting capability. When tested in DSSCs, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.04% is obtained by SPA, and this followed by PCEs of 2.97, 2.35 and 2.01% for FPA, RBV and FBV, respectively. The lowest PCE for FBV can be attributed to poor electron transfer ability, which may cause reduced photocurrent and photovoltage. On the other hand, after 120 h of sunlight irradiation, FBV, RBV, FPA and SPA retained the PCE values as 91, 54, 63 and 69% of the initial efficiencies. The moderate photovoltaic performance with good photostability for the anthocyanin extract may favorable for low-cost and environmental-friendly DSSC applications.\", \"Background/purpose: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is responsible for sunburns, skin cancer, photoaging, and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The awareness on preventing these deleterious effects made the use of anti-UVB formulations an important part of population habits; however, despite the availability of several antioxidants capable of ROS scavenging, the pharmaceutical market lacks products associating UV filters with natural compounds of proven efficacy. Here, we investigated the effect of rutin, a flavonoid with antioxidant activity, associated with UVB filters in dermocosmetic preparations.\\nMethods: Formulations were assessed through its antioxidant activity, in vitro photoprotective effectiveness, photostability, and in vivo skin tolerance (hydration, transepidermal water loss, and erythema).\\nResults: Samples containing rutin were compatible with the human skin and presented a pronounced antioxidant potential, with scavenging activity values 75% higher than the ones containing only UVB filters. Although rutin could not prevent the sunscreens photodegradation post-irradiation, the bioactive compound significantly increased the formulations critical wavelengths, showing a photoprotective gain, especially in the UVA range.\\nConclusion: In conclusion, the absorption in the UVA range, coupled with ROS scavenging potential, proved the positive effect of rutin applied to anti-UVB formulations, making this bioactive compound a promising candidate for photoprotection improvement.\", \"Quantum dot sensitized photoanodes have drawn much attention due to their high potential as efficient anodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting or solar cells. However the photocorrosion of QDs is the crucial barrier for applications in these devices. The in situ analysis of photocorrosion is important in understanding its mechanism and also developing the possible solution for photocorrosion. In this study we have developed a novel, integrated analysis system for in situ measurements of photocorrosion and PEC performances. We have fabricated the CdSe/CdS/ZnO nanowire (NW) arrays on quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) as a platform for usage as PEC photoanodes and also mass analysis at the same time. The in situ measuring of photocurrents and mass changes were performed with continuous operation of PEC cells for CdSe/CdS/ZnO NWs photoanode. The study exhibited highly correlated tendency in photocurrent decrease and mass reduction, due to photocorrosion of CdSe/CdS/ZnO NWs. Also to improve the photostability of CdSe/CdS/ZnO NWs, applications of passivation and catalysts were studied and their effects were discussed. Our integrated in situ analysis system is highly applicable to various semiconductor sensitized systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The recently discovered and rapidly developed aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) are excellent candidates because they exhibit enhanced emission upon the restriction of intramolecular motions (RIM) effect. AIEgens are individually lit up once bound with biomolecules or influenced by the surrounding bio-environment, and abundant biological information can be acquired on the basis of high-sensitivity fluorescence imaging. In addition, AIEgen-incorporated nanoparticles possess bright fluorescence and improved photostability, which is beneficial to long-term bioimaging with high contrast and spatial resolution.

However, the mechanism by which photostabilization is mediated has yet to be determined. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence that COT, when covalently linked to Cy5, substantially reduces the lifetime of the Cy5 triplet state and that the degree of triplet state quenching correlates with enhancements in photostability observed in single molecule fluorescence measurements. By contrast, NBA and Trolox did not quench the Cy5 triplet state under our conditions, suggesting that their mechanism of photostabilization is different from that of COT and does not target the fluorophore triplet state directly. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of fluorophore photostabilization that may lead to improved fluorophore designs for biological imaging applications.\", \"Drugs degrade to different extents on separate exposure to heat, moisture, oxidation and light. Combination of these stresses causes very complex behaviour. Many studies have been reported of the thermal behaviour of drugs in the solid-state, but most of the information available on the photodegradation of drugs refers to reactions in solution, (usually aqueous) and photoreactions in the solid-state are even more complex. In drug formulations, the presence of excipients adds further complications because the excipients may increase, have no effect on, or decrease the inherent stabilities of the drug.

Therefore, this work abstracted by two parts, first, synthesis of Schiff bases 1-4 compounds through the reaction of amino group with appropriate aromatic aldehyde, reaction of PVC with Schiff bases compounds 1-4 in THF to form a new modified PVC-1, PVC-2, PVC-3, and PVC-4. The structures of Schiff bases 1-4 and the modified PVC-1, PVC-2, PVC-3, and PVC-4 have been characterized by different spectroscopic analyses. Second, the influence of introducing 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole as a pendent groups into PVC chain investigated on photostability rules of tests. The modified polymers photostability investigated by observing indices (I-CO, I-po, and I-OH), weight loss, UV and morphological studies, and all results obtained indicated that PVC-1, PVC-2, PVC-3 and PVC-4 gave lower growth rate of I-CO, I-PO, and I-OH through UV exposure time.

After the photocatalyst was decorated with Au-x-GSH NCs, the photocatalytic activity and photostability of CdS were remarkably enhanced. Compared to pure CdS, the as-prepared CdS-Pt-Au-c photocatalyst exhibited 9 times of photocurrent and 2.85 times of photocatalytic activity. More importantly, the photocorrosion of CdS, which is a critical drawback for CdS-based photocatalysts, was significantly suppressed. It is believed that the heterostructures and matched energy levels between CdS and Au-x-GSH NCs are the key for enhance catalytic activity and photostability. The level of LUMO and HOMO of Au-x-GSH NCs is higher the conduction band and valence band of CdS respectively. Through the heterostructures, the photogenerated electrons of Au-x-GSH NCs are injected into the CdS, while the photogenerated holes of CdS transferred to the Au-x-GSH NCs. The opposite directions of charge migration improves the charge separation efficiency and average lifetime, which drastically enhances the photoactivity, and the rapid transferring of holes from CdS to Au-x-GSH NCs significantly suppresses the photocorrosion of CdS.

The method used a RP-18 column, mobile phase composed of a methanol:acetonitrile:water pH 5.0 mixture (50:10:40) and detection at 244nm. The method validation followed the ICH guidelines, and its robustness was evaluated by a factorial design (2(4)). All the validation requirements were met, evidenced by good linearity (r>0.9999, in the range from 10 to 100 mu g/mL), accuracy (mean recovery 100.09%), precision (intra-day RSD 1.4 and 1.75%; inter-day RSD 1.59%), robustness, and specificity.

These data confirm the procedure suitability to routine analysis and stability studies. About the photodegradation of desonide lotion, it can be described by second-order kinetics with a t90% value of 1.58h under the experimental conditions employed in this study.

Present study aimed to develop a respirable powder formulation for PFD (PFD-RP) to minimize phototoxic risk.\\nPhotochemical properties of PFD were examined using a reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay and photostability testing. PFD-RP was characterized with a focus on photostability, in vitro inhalation performance, and the efficacy in antigen-sensitized rats. Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted after oral and intratracheal administration of PFD formulations.\\nAlthough PFD solution exhibited photodegradation under simulated sunlight (250 W/m(2)), both PFD powder and PFD-RP were photochemically stable. Laser diffraction and cascade impactor analyses on PFD-RP suggested its high dispersion and fine in vitro inhalation performance. Inhaled PFD-RP (300 mu g-PFD/rat) could suppress antigen-evoked pulmonary inflammation in rats as evidenced by decreases in recruited inflammatory cells and neutrophilia-related biomarkers in the lung. Exposure of PFD to light-exposed tissues (skin and eye) after intratracheal administration of PFD-RP at a pharmacologically effective dose (300 mu g-PFD/rat) was 90-130-fold less than that of the oral PFD dosage form at a phototoxic dose (160 mg/kg).\\nPFD-RP might be an attractive alternative to the current oral PFD therapy with a better safety margin.\", \"Carbon materials are excellent candidates for photovoltaic solar cells: they are Earth-abundant, possess high optical absorption, and maintain superior thermal and photostability. Here we report on solar cells with active layers made solely of carbon nanomaterials that present the same advantages of conjugated polymer-based solar cells, namely, solution processable, potentially flexible, and chemically tunable, but with increased photostability and the possibility to revert photodegradation. The device active layer composition is optimized using ab initio density functional theory calculations to predict type-II band alignment and Schottky barrier formation. The best device fabricated is composed of PC70BM fullerene, semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes, and reduced graphene oxide. This active-layer composition achieves a power conversion efficiency of 1.3%-a record for solar cells based on carbon as the active material-and we calculate efficiency limits of up to 13% for the devices fabricated in this work, comparable to those predicted for polymer solar cells employing PCBM as the acceptor. There is great promise for improving carbon-based solar cells considering the novelty of this type of device, the high photostability, and the availability of a large number of carbon materials with yet untapped potential for photovoltaics.

Right-handed B-DNA, spermine-induced Z-DNA and Co(III)-induced Z-DNA have been explored. Resonance light scattering (RLS) spectra showed formation of porphyrin aggregates in the presence of all DNA forms with the largest aggregates formed with B-DNA. The porphyrin dimer gave rise to induced bisignate circular dichroism (CD) signals in the presence of the left-handed Z-DNA conformations. On the other hand, the dimer stayed nearly chiroptically silent when complexed with the B-form of poly(dG-dC)(2). Our results indicated that the conjugated Zn(II) porphyrin dimer can be used as a sensor for the chiroptical detection of Z-DNA in the visible (400-500 nm) and near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum (700-800 nm). The helicity of DNA had little effect on the dimer binding affinities. The photostability of the porphyrin dimer complexed with any form of DNA was higher than that of the free molecule.

The physicochemical properties of the synthesized catalysts were examined using various spectrophotometers. The newly developed NTACN samples displayed an enhanced photocatalytic activity in producing hydrogen. Specifically, the H2 production rate of NTACN-5 (with a NT-to-ACN weight ratio of 5) was 3351 mu mol/g-h, which was 1.42 times higher than that of ACN-4 with a Ag-to-CN ratio of 4 (2325 mu mol/g-h). The effects of the Ag-to-CN and NiTiO3-to-ACN ratios on the photocatalytic activity of NTACN photocatalysts were determined. The NTACN photo catalysts exhibited a high long-term photostability under simulated sunlight irradiation. The increased photocatalyst performance and photostability were primarily ascribed to an improved charge separation efficiency due to a Z-scheme reaction mechanism as well as the assistance provided by Ag as a charge transfer shuttle and in the surface plasmon resonance effect. A photocatalytic mechanism for hydrogen generation over the NTACN photocatalysts under simulated sunlight irradiation is suggested. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Two commercial formulations were analyzed with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and bioluminescent bacterium Q67 before and after artificial daylight irradiation. Different decomposition functions and toxicity changes were obtained. Ingredients and concentration level of chloramphenicol in preparations caused the differences in photodegradation processes. High concentration level of propanediol and chloramphenicol enhanced the photostability of injection, whereas photodegradtion of 2-Amino-1-(4-nitrophenyl) propane-1,3-diol increased the efficiency of photolysis of chloramphenicol and toxicity of eye drops.

Counting by photon statistics measures the distribution of multiple photon detection events that carry information about the number and brightness of independently emitting fluorophores. The method enables absolute and non-destructive quantification, with the quality of estimates critically depending on the ability to accurately measure said photon statistics. Here, we present a combination of simulations and experiments that relate fundamental properties of fluorophores, i.e. their molecular brightness and photostability, to important experimental conditions, i.e. excitation power and acquisition time. Thereby, experimental settings and analysis parameters can be quantitatively evaluated, making counting by photon statistics a robust method for absolute counting of the number of emitters in a diffraction limited observation volume. We show that the time-resolution of counting varies with the fluorophore brightness and can be as fast as 10-100 ms. At the same time, the range of suitable fluorophores can be easily assessed. We evaluated the brightness and photostability of 16 organic dyes across the visible spectrum, providing information crucial for a range of single-molecule spectroscopy applications. This opens up exciting possibilities to analyze absolute stoichiometries in dynamic multi-component complexes.\", \"In this paper, we report the photodegradation of three different chlorine photosensitizers (Photoditazine (R), Radachlorin (R), and Foscan (R)). The photosensitizer degradation was analyzed by changes in the fluorescence spectrum during illumination. The rate of fluorescence variation was normalized to the solution absorption and the photon energy resulting in the determination of the necessary number of photons to be absorbed to induce photosensitizer photodegradation. The parameter for rate of the molecules decay, the photon fluence rate and optical properties of the solution allow us to determine the photosensitizer stability in solution during illumination. The results show that the order of susceptibility for photodegradation rate is: Radachlorin (R) < Photoditazine (R) < Foscan (R). This difference in the photodegradation rate for Foscan can be explained by the high proportion of aggregates in solution that inhibit the photo-oxidative process that impede the singlet oxygen formation. We hypothesize that there is a correlation between photodegradation rate and photodynamic efficacy witch is governed by the singlet oxygen formation responsible for the most relevant reaction of the cell death photodynamic induction. Then its is important to know the photostability of different types of drugs since the photodegradation rate, the photodegradation as well as the photodynamic efficacy are strong correlated to the oxygen concentration in the tissue.\", \"In this work, the role of conducting [poly (p-phenylinevinylene) (PPV)] and nonconducting (polystyrene) polymers on the properties of their respective composites with CdSe quantum dots of varied sizes has been investigated. The emission and structural properties of polymer-CdSe composites are found to be dependent on the crystallite size and morphology of CdSe nanocrystallites. Smaller CdSe quantum dots (size, similar to 5 nm) ensures efficient charge transfer process across polymer-CdSe interface as evident by almost complete quenching of photoluminescence (PL) emission as compared to larger CdSe quantum dots (size, similar to 7 nm). Presence of residual trioctylphosphine (TOP)/ tri-n-octylphosphine-oxide (TOPO) species and agglomeration of particles act as a hindrance for quenching of emission and hence charge transfer for larger CdSe nanocrystallites. Emission studies indicated an increased conjugation length for PPV polymers in different solvents (toluene, pyridine) and in solid state. Nonconducting polymer polystyrene shows charge transfer across polymer-CdSe interface as well. However, polystyrene polymer has a shorter chain length, which ensures maximum coverage on the surface of CdSe nanocrystallites and provides better photostability to CdSe QDs within the polymer matrix as compared to that for PPV-CdSe nanocomposites.\", \"The photoprotective role of a family of compounds found in very different organisms is assessed by means of CASPT2//CASSCF computations.

TEM and XPS analyses demonstrated the existence of Ag on the nanocrystal surface. In addition, we utilize single-particle spectroscopy combined with in situ light analysis to further confirm the PL enhancement effect.

Low temperature PL at low excitation intensities reveals the presence of boron in Si-ncs. The photoconductivity measurements showed that the light absorption in the Si-nc/MEH-PPV films lead to a charge separation.

The fact that the anti-Stokes signal is averaged differently from the Stokes counterpart leads to some unique phenomena in Raman spectroscopy that can only be observed under the conditions of vibrational pumping in SERS.\", \"In this critical and timely review, the effects of anisotropic silver nanostructures on the emission intensity and photostability of a key fluorophore that is frequently used in many biological assays is examined. The silver nanostructures consist of triangular, rod-like, and fractal-like nanoparticles of silver deposited on conventional glass substrates. The close proximity to silver nanostructures results in greater intensity and photostability of the fluorophore than for fluorophores solely deposited on glass substrates.

Using the comet assay, DNA strand breaks and oxidative DNA damage were detected. Then, accumulation of p53 protein was studied as a marker for UV-induced genotoxic stress. Such a method was used to compare formulations with different photostability. Spectroradiometry showed that a photo-unstable formulation lost its effectiveness in UVA screening when pre-irradiated by simulated sunlight.

In other experiments, the principal photodegradation products of the dyes were identified with the aid of GC/MS, and it was found that those cyanine dyes holding a positive charge had higher photostability than the corresponding merocyanines. The relationship between photostability and chemical structure was established using PM3 and AMI MO calculations. Experimental results in this regard suggest that the species associated with the photodegradation of cyanine dyes may be the semioxidized dye free radical cation, Dye(dagger).

Photostability was studied on a small scale as thin films of approximately 1mg drug, which contained either amorphous or re-crystallised stable phases. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed a greater rate and extent of decomposition for the amorphous phases. Photoexposed amorphous nifedipine exhibited approximately 1.8-fold larger first-order decomposition rate constant (k) relative to its crystalline phase. The increase in k was more significant for photoexposed amorphous nimodipine at approximately sixfold relative to its crystalline phase. Photodecomposition in scaled-up samples of the stable crystalline phases for both drugs was monitored with X-ray diffraction in BraggBrentano geometry. The similarities in the calculated photodecomposition extents to results from small scale validated the specificity of the X-ray analysis technique to the photodecomposition region. The considerably faster decomposition rates in small-scale studies were attributed to a maximised surface area (A) for quantity (m0) of exposed drug. Kinetic interpretations of true solid-state stability should consider the sample solid dimensions in terms of the direct exposed A and m0 in the photodecomposition region, that is, outer layers in solid.

From ESR analyses, butyrylation reduces the amount of phenoxyl free radicals of MWL after UV irradiation, which results in inhibiting the photo-oxidation of lignin followed by a significant decrease in the formation of colored chromophores. The carbonyl, carboxyl and quinonoid structures were less detected in the butyrylated MWL after UV irradiation than those of untreated MWL, and the content of degraded water-soluble materials from the photo-degradation of MWL was also reduced upon butyrylation.

Here, we investigate how a solution-processed copper (I) iodide (CuI) hole transport layer (HTL) prepared onto indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates affects the photovoltaic performances of the devices based on Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT): Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), with its different thicknesses. We found that the film morphology and roughness depends sensitively on the concentration of CuI solutions used for thin films. The surface of CuI films spun with high concentration solutions consists of large grains with high roughness, resulting in a direct short in the devices. For the devices with a thin CuI layer, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices under illumination was observed to decrease with time. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggests that the indium ions might be diffused into the active layer across the thin CuI layer.

However, they can be limited by low photoacoustic generation efficiency and low optical absorption at red and near infrared wavelengths, thus limiting their usefulness in mammalian small animal models. In addition, many fluorescent proteins exhibit low photostability due to photobleaching and transient absorption effects. In this study, we explore these issues by synthesizing and characterizing a range of commonly used fluorescent proteins (dsRed, mCherry, mNeptune, mRaspberry, AQ143, E2 Crimson) and novel non-fluorescent chromoproteins (aeCP597 and cjBlue and a non-fluorescent mutant of E2 Crimson). The photoacoustic spectra, photoacoustic generation efficiency and photostability of each fluorescent protein and chromoprotein were measured. Compared to the fluorescent proteins, the chromoproteins were found to exhibit higher photoacoustic generation efficiency due to the absence of radiative relaxation and ground state depopulation, and significantly higher photostability. The feasibility of converting an existing fluorescent protein into a non-fluorescent chromoprotein via mutagenesis was also demonstrated. The chromoprotein mutant exhibited greater photoacoustic signal generation efficiency and better agreement between the photoacoustic and the specific extinction coefficient spectra than the original fluorescent protein. Lastly, the genetic expression of a chromoprotein in mammalian cells was demonstrated.

The phase-solubility diagram revealed the formation of a 1 : 1 inclusion complex of CP-HPCD with a stability constant (k(s)) of 487 M-1. Formation of the inclusion complex of CP-HPCD was analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Changes in chemical shifts of the H-1-nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of CP-HPCD demonstrated that the inclusion site of CP by HPCD was carbazolyl aromatic ring skeleton rather than the side chain of propanoic acid. The photostability study revealed that the CP-HPCD complex could not significantly decrease the rate of photodegradation of CP, implying that the rate-determining step of CP mainly occurred at the side chain. The dissolution rates of CP were significantly enhanced as the proportions of HPCD increased in the prepared discs.

Therefore, in this paper, we tried to purposely not wash the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals solution after adding didodecyl dimethylammonium bromide (DDAB), and found the existing of DDAB in solution could result in a dramatically enhanced photostability. Inspired by these results, we proposed a new strategy to stabilize perovskite nanocrystals from the view of packaging process: adding protective ligands into the perovskite nanocrystals resin directly, then encapsulating them on blue light-emitting diodes (LED) chips. Surprisingly, stable LED devices (20 mA, 2.7V) were achieved by this way, which can keep 80% of the initial photoluminescence (PL) intensity for more than 50 h, while the devices with CsPbBr3 nanocrystals without adding protective ligands into resin dropped to 50% of their initial PL intensity within 6 h.

Usually, host-ligand binding interactions can be assessed monitoring CD changes of the host biopolymer upon ligand addition. The novel method of identifying ligand binding monitoring the change of relative rate of UV denaturation using SRCD is especially important when there are very little or insignificant secondary structure changes of the host protein upon ligand binding. The temperature study, another method used to determine molecular interactions, can often be inconclusive when the thermal effect associated with the displacement of the bound solvent molecules by the ligand is also small, making the determination of the binding interaction inconclusive. Herein we present a review on the UV-denaturation assay as a novel method to determine the relative photostability of protein formulations as well as the screening of ligand-binding interactions using the high photon flux Diamond B23 beamline for SRCD.\", \"Native quantum dots (QDs) made up of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) are toxic in nature but due to their excellent optical properties, they have proven themselves to be an attractive choice in biological labeling and targeting. In order to improve the general biocompatibility of lead sulfide (PbS) NCs, we present a new and simple procedure for preparing PbS/gelatin core-shell nanoparticles cross-linked with glutaraldehyde (GA) molecules. The phase composition, morphology, luminescence and in vitro photostability of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and fluorescence spectroscopy, respectively. The XRD analysis showed that the PbS NCs were of the cubic structure, the mean crystallite size was calculated to be 13.5 nm and the calculated lattice constant using Bragg's equation was 0.5950 nm, which was very close to its value in the standard card (JCPDS No. 5-592). In vitro test revealed that compared with bare PbS NCs, the photostability of the core-shell nanostructure remarkably improved. In addition, possible formation mechanisms of the PbS/gelatin nanoparticles were discussed in detail. Consequently, the advantages of high stability as well as high fluorescent intensity and biocompatibility make the core-shell nanoparticles promising candidates for in vivo biological targeting applications.

Rutin-loaded nanocapsules and rutin-loaded nanoemulsion showed mean particle size of 124.30 +/- A 2.06 and 124.17 +/- A 1.79, respectively, polydispersity index below 0.20, negative zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency close to 100%. The in vitro antioxidant activity was evaluated by the formation of free radical center dot OH after the exposure of hydrogen peroxide to a UV irradiation system. Rutin-loaded nanostructures showed lower rutin decay rates [(6.1 +/- A 0.6) 10(-3) and (5.1 +/- A 0.4) 10(-3) for nanocapsules and nanoemulsion, respectively] compared to the ethanolic solution [(35.0 +/- A 3.7) 10(-3) min(-1)] and exposed solution [(40.1 +/- A 1.7) 10(-3) min(-1)] as well as compared to exposed nanostructured dispersions [(19.5 +/- A 0.5) 10(-3) and (26.6 +/- A 2.6) 10(-3), for nanocapsules and nanoemulsion, respectively]. The presence of the polymeric layer in nanocapsules was fundamental to obtain a prolonged antioxidant activity, even if the mathematical modeling of the in vitro release profiles showed high adsorption of rutin to the particle/droplet surface for both formulations. Rutin-loaded nanostructures represent alternatives to the development of innovative nanomedicines.\", \"Rhodamine 6G (R6G) was adsorbed on smectite clays, a natural montmorillonite, a synthetic saponite, and synthetic hectorites, and the decolorization of the dyes upon visible light irradiation was examined for aqueous suspensions and cast films. Excellent dye stability was achieved when a natural montmorillonite was used. Apart from R6G, better photostability was also achieved when the tris(2,2'-bipyridine)ruthenium(II) complex was adsorbed on a natural montmorillonite. The excited state of the dye was quenched efficiently by the impurities in the natural montmorillonite. From the relationship between the excited-state quenching (as derived from photoluminescence quantum efficiency and photoluminescence intensity) and the decolorization rate constant, the quenching of the excited state of the dye adsorbed on the natural montmorillonite was proposed as the important mechanism for the stabilization of dyes upon photoirradiation.\", \"A novel nickel(II)-containing conducting metallopolymer utilizing thieno[3,2-b]thiophene moieties as the electropolymerizable groups is synthesized and characterized. A metal-free polymer is also obtained via electropolymerization of the title ligand allowing comparative studies of the electrochemical and spectroscopic properties of the polymer system in the presence and absence of nickel(II) metal ions. Photodegradation of the two polymers is studied along with an analogous system incorporating bithiophene as the electropolymerizable groups. Stability is found to be comparable between the metal-free thieno[3,2-b]thiophene- and bithiophene-based polymers; however, significant enhancement is observed in the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-based nickel(II) conducting metallopolymer.\", \"Despite common presumption due to fast photodestruction pathways through higher excited states, we show that further improvement of photostability is still achievable with diffusion-limited photoprotection formulas. Single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy reveals that thiolate ions effectively quench triplet states of dyes by photoinduced electron transfer. Interestingly, this reaction rarely yields a radical anion of the dye, but direct return to the ground state is promoted by an almost instantaneous back electron transfer (geminate recombination). This type of mechanism is not detected for commonly used reductants such as ascorbic acid and trolox. The mechanism avoids the formation of radical cations and improves the photostability of single fluorophores. We find that a combination of beta-mercaptoethanol and classical reducing and oxidizing systems yields the best results for several dyes including Atto532 and Alexa568.\", \"A novel hindered amine ligand, mono-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl-succinate (MTPS), has been designed to chelate europium(III) ion with 1,10-phenanthroline (Phen) as a coligand to prepare polymer photostabilizer. The luminescent property of the stabilizer and its efficiency of protecting polymer matrix from photodegradation have also been investigated. Under UV excitation, the stabilizer has red light emission in both ethanol solution and polypropylene (PP) matrix. The PP sheets containing the stabilizer display significantly improved photostability, which may be attributed to MTPS which scavenges radical, as well as Phen which makes the complex dissipate the absorbed ultraviolet light in a harmless manner. These preliminary results demonstrate that the introduction of the stabilizer can endow polymer matrices not only excellent photoluminescent properties but also improved photostability.

The Eu(DBM)(3)phen complexes are uniformly distributed into the channels of the modified SBA-15. The luminescent properties of Eu(DBM)(3)phen@MSBA-15 composite are systematically studied in contrast to the pure complexes. The results indicate that the excitation bands assigned to the pi-pi* electron transition of the ligands in Eu(DBM)(3)phen@MSBA-15 are narrower than that in Eu3+ complexes, and the D-5(0)-F-7(0) transitions emmission become partly allowed. The emission lines for the D-5(0)-F-7(2) transitions become broader. The photostability of the emissions improves considerably, which is essential for future applications of RE complexes in molecular optical and electrical devices.\", \"In this study, water-soluble fluorescent carbon nanodots (CNDs) were directly injected into the leaf of nicotiana tabacum. With the help of UV-to-blue light conversion nanomaterial, the photosynthetic rate of the leaf was improved 18% upon additional 6 W UV irradiation. The photostability and toxicity of different kinds of CNDs were discussed. The results showed that CNDs functionalized with NH2-groups on their surfaces could maintain good fluorescence in plant leaf, and CNDs with complex surface groups tended to have high toxicity to the plant. The NH2-functionalized CNDs with non-toxicity and good photostability were used as in vivo light conversion material for direct utilization of UV light in the solar energy.\", \"There is little information about pesticide photostability on plants, especially when considering the effects of the formulation. We evaluated the photostability of a herbicide, mesotrione, on wax films. These surfaces are good systems to mimic the outer layer of the leaf. Within the range of recommended agricultural rates, pure mesotrione half-life on cuticular wax films was between 100 and 160 min. Formulated, the phototransformation rate was multiplied by a factor of 4.8. We assume that the acceleration is mainly due to the surfactants, agents that allow a better spreading of the active ingredient at the leaf surface. Since mesotrione photolysis is a fast process on wax films, we can assume that this process would be significant in the field after treatment.\", \"We report on the intercalation of a cationic fluorescent oligo(fluorene) in between the 2D interlayer region of a fluoromica type silicate. The formation of intercalated structures with different fluorophore contents is observed in powders by synchrotron radiation XRD. Successively, the hybrids are dispersed in poly(styrene) through in situ polymerization. Such a procedure allows us to synthesize the materials from solution, to achieve solid films, and to characterize them by optical and morphologic techniques. The polymeric films with homogeneous distribution of the hybrids exhibit ultraviolet-blue photoluminescence with a significantly enhanced photostability compared to the bare oligo(fluorene)s. Finally, under specific conditions, the polymer hybrid with higher oligo(fluorene) content spontaneously assembles into highly ordered microporous films.\", \"Several novel fluorinated fluoresceins (Oregon Green dyes) were prepared by the reaction of fluororesorcinols with phthalic anhydride and its derivatives. A novel regiospecific synthesis of fluororesorcinols was key to the successful synthesis of these new fluorophores. (Polyfluoro)-nitrobenzenes were reacted with 2 equiv of sodium methoxide followed by reduction, hydrodediazoniation, and demethylation, giving the first straightforward synthesis of 2-fluororesorcinol, 4-fluororesorcinol, 2,4-difluororesorcinol, and 2,4,5-trifluororesorcinol. These fluorinated fluoresceins have higher photostability and ionize at a lower pH (pK(a) = 3.3-6.1) than fluorescein (pK(a) = 6.5). Some of the fluorinated fluoresceins have very high quantum yields (0.85-0.97), which, in combination with their lower pK(a)s and high photostability, makes them superior fluorescent dyes for use as reporter molecules in biological systems.\", \"Based on the unique advantages of fluorescent silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs), long circulation red blood cells (RBCs), and anti-cancer drug molecules (i.e., doxorubicin (DOX)), we developed multifunctional DOX-loaded SiNPs impregnated into RBCs. Importantly, the resulting drug delivery systems (DDSs) simultaneously exhibited bright fluorescence coupled with robust photostability (i.e., similar to 24% loss of fluorescent intensity after 25 min continuous laser irradiation) and significantly lengthened blood residency (i.e., t(1/2) = 7.31 +/- 0.96 h, 3.9-fold longer than pure DOX-loaded SiNPs). Therefore, this novel DDS featuring multi-functionalities shows high potential for cancer diagnosis and therapy, particularly for tumor imaging and chemotherapy in a synchronous manner.\", \"MK8383, isolated from Phoma sp. T2526 in 1993, exhibits potent antibiotic activities against a variety of phytopathogens and has been considered a promising fungicide against Botrytis cinerea. Unfortunately, MK8383 is a photosensitive compound and it undergoes irreversible decomposition. Although much effort has been devoted to improving the photostability of MK8383 by chemical modification of its structure by a research group organized by Meiji Seika Kaishya, Ltd. and Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, a photostable MK8383 derivative has never been prepared. We have found that a C13-14 double bond of MK8383 and (+)-phomopsidin is responsible for the photosensitivity, and herein, we report the synthesis of NH006, an MK8383 derivative with a saturated C13-14 double bond and (S) configuration at C14, based on the asymmetric total synthesis of MK8383. NH006 exhibits good photostability and potent antifungal activity against B. cinerea.\", \"Solid-state aryl benzobisoxazole and aryl benzobisthiazole compounds photolyzed in the presence of O-2 undergo cleavage to produce benzobisoxazoles (or benzobisthiazoles), benzonitriles, and benzamides. A very high percentage of the carbon atoms in one of the two segments from chain cleavage are converted to CO2. This very unusual observation has been carefully confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy analysis of the gaseous components in the photolysis vessel before and after photolysis, labeling experiments, and the correlation of the mass reduction in photolyzed polymers and the amount of CO2 that evolves. The rate of CO2 generation is used to compare the relative photostability of aryl benzobisoxazole and aryl benzobisthiazole model compounds, films, and fibers.

The experiments were carried out in the air, and in oxygen or nitrogen atmosphere at different temperatures. The parameters such as fluorescence yield, the yield of triplet state generation and photostability were estimated. On the basis of these parameters an attempt was made to preliminary select the pigments best suited for medical applications. It seems that the photosensitive and highly fluorescent bacteriochlorophyll c could be used as a fluorescence probe for diagnosis, whereas its derivative without the magnesium ion is better suited for the photochemical reactions occurring during therapeutic treatment.

Alprazolam was found to be highly photolabile and special care should be taken to avoid light exposure during alprazolam storage and handling. The photostability of alprazolam was evaluated at pH 2.0, 3.6 and 5.0. The drug was exposed to UVA-UVB radiations, the photodegradation of alprazolam was followed by high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) and the developed spectrofluorimetric assay allowed determination of the photodegradation products at very low concentrations ( greater than or equal to 10(-5) M). The photoinstability was found to increase with the pH value decreasing, consequently acidic media should be avoided during the drug-development process. (C) 2002 by Elsevier Science B.V.

To reduce the cytotoxicity of PEI, citric acid (CA) was introduced for aqueous modification, and PEI assembly was introduced on the UCNP surface. Our data show that the nonviral vector for UCL gene-delivery demonstrates excellent photostability, low toxicity, and good stability under physiological or serum conditions and can strongly bind to DNA.

The dimerization of two isolated thymine bases is found to have no barrier or a very small barrier in agreement with previous studies suggesting low photostability of DNA. The well-known high photostability of DNA can only be explained taking other factors into account. We investigate the role of the exciton location in the particular environment. Different model systems, from isolated thymine bases to an oligonucleotide in aqueous solution, are discussed. Analysis of the frontier orbitals allows one to understand the connection between the location of the exciton, the relative orientation of the thymine bases, and the observed reactivity.\", \"We present single-molecule fluorescence data of fluorescent proteins GFP, YFP, DsRed, and mCherry, a new derivative of DsRed. Ensemble and single-molecule fluorescence experiments proved mCherry as an ideally suited fluorophore for single-molecule applications, demonstrated by high photostability and rare fluorescence-intensity fluctuations. Although mCherry exhibits the lowest fluorescence quantum yield among the fluorescent proteins investigated, its superior photophysical characteristics suggest mCherry as an ideal alternative in single-molecule fluorescence experiments. Due to its spectral characteristics and short fluorescence lifetime of 1.46 ns, mCherry complements other existing fluorescent proteins and is recommended for tracking and localization of target molecules with high accuracy, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), or multicolor applications.\\n[GRAPHICS]\\nmCherry exhibits a relatively high photostability and brightness under single-molecule fluorescence imaging conditions.

However, many organic fluorophores show poor photostability under one-photon and two-photon continuous irradiation. In addition, these traditional fluorophores also suffer from aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) in aggregate state in insolvable water environment. Therefore, it remains challenging to develop photostable and ACQ-free fluorophores for biological imaging. In this work, we developed two highly photostable aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AlEgens) based on the cyanostilbene core for in vitro and ex vivo bioimaging. These AlEgens named CS-Py+ SO3- and CS-Py+ exhibit near-infrared solid-state emission, large Stokes shift (> 180 nm), high fluorescence quantum yield (12.8%-13.7%) and good two-photon absorption cross section (up to 88 GM). CS-Py+ SO3- and CS-Py+ show specific organelle staining with high biocompatibility in membrane and mitochondria in live cells, respectively. In addition, selective two-photon mitochondria visualization in live rat skeletal muscle tissues with deep-tissue penetration (about 100 tun) is successfully realized by using CS-Py+. Furthermore, these AlEgens especially CS-Py+ exhibit remarkably high resistance to photobleaching under one-photon and two-photon continuous irradiation. These highly photostable AlEgens could be potentially utilized in visualizing and tracking specific organelle-associated dynamic changes in live systems.\", \"This paper developed a rhodamine-based chemosensor for cysteine optical sensing. Aiming at improved photostability, up-conversion excitation nanocrystals were constructed, serving as excitation source. After being modified by alpha-cyclodextrin, these excitation nanocrystals became water dispersible. It was found that their up-conversion emission overlapped well with absorption of our chemosensor, resulting in an efficiency energy transfer between them which was confirmed by emission decay lifetime analysis. Further analysis suggested that the sensing mechanism between our chemosensor and cysteine was a simple complexation one with binding stoichiometry of 1:1.

In comparison with the commercially available mitochondrial trackers, Ru1 possesses high mitochondria-specificity, superior photostability, high resistance to the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and appreciable tolerance to environmental change, allowing imaging of the mitochondrial morphological changes over long periods of time.

Additionally, the impact of some factors important for efficient waste treatment were studied. For this purpose a stability of terazosine aqueous solutions under the influence of UV, UV+H2O2, Fenton, and photo-Fenton processes and sunlight was studied. The presence of H2O2 and Fe (II) ions increases the rate of transformation. The process of direct photolysis and H2O2-assisted photoreaction showed first order kinetics, while dark and photo-Fenton reactions exhibited second-order kinetics.\", \"Highly fluorescent conjugated polymer dots were developed for demanding applications such as fluorescence imaging in live cells.

Single particle fluorescence imaging and kinetic studies indicate much higher emission rates (similar to 10(8) s(-1)) and little or no blinking of the nanoparticles as compared to typical results for single dye molecules and quantum dots. Analysis of single particle photobleaching trajectories reveals excellent photostability-as many as 10(9) or more photons emitted per nanoparticle prior to irreversible photobleaching. The superior figures of merit of these new fluorescent probes, together with the demonstration of cellular imaging, indicate their enormous potential for demanding fluorescence-based imaging and sensing applications such as high speed super-resolution single molecule/particle tracking and highly sensitive assays.\"]"
